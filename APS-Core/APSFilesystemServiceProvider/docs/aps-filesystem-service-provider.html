    <H1>APSFilesystemService</H1>
    <p>
      This provides a filesystem for writing and reading files. This filesystem resides outside of the OSGi server and is for longterm storage, which differs from BundleContext.getDataFile() which resides within bundle deployment. The APSFilesystemService also does not return a File object! It priovides a file area for each unique owner name that is accessed through an API that cannot navigate nor access any files outside of this area. The ”owner” name should be either an application name or a bundle name if it is only used by one bundle.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The APSConfigService uses the APSFilesystemService to store its configurations.

    <H2>Setup</H2>
    <p>
      The <em>aps.filesystem.root</em> system property must be set to point to a root where this service provides its file areas. This is either passed to the JVM at server startup or configured withing the server. Glassfish allows you to configure properties within its admin gui. Virgo does not. If this is not provided the service will use BundleContext.getDataFile(".") as the root, which will work for testing and playing around, but should not be used for more serious purposes since this is not a path with a long term availability.      
    </p>
    <H2>The service</H2>
    <p>
      The service allows you to create or get an APSFilesystem object. From that object you can create/read/delete directories (represented by APSDirectory) and files (represented by APSFile). You can get readers, writers, input streams and output streams from files. All paths are relative to the file area represented by the APSFilesystem object.
