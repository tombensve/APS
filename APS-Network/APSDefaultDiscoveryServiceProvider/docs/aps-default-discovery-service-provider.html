    <H1>APSDefaultDiscoveryServiceProvider</H1>
    <p>
      This is a simple service where you can publish and unpublish service information. This information will be distributed to all other nodes that are configured to be part of the disovery.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Service data can be configured to be shared by any of the 3 TCP/IP protocols: Multicast, UDP, and TCP. The <em>APSTCPIPService</em> is used to send and receive data.      
    </p>
    <H2>Discovery information</H2>
    <p>
      The discovery information is just a Properties object. Anything you want can be put into it, but the following keys are suggested for interoperability:      
    </p>
