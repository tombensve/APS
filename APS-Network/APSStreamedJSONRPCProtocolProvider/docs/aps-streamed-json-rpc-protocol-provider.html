    <H1>APSStreamedJSONRPCProtocolProvider</H1>
    <p>
      This provides JSONRPC protocol. It provides both version 1.0 and 2.0 of the protocol. It requires a transport that uses it and services provided by aps-external-protocol-extender to be useful.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The 1.0 version of the JSONRPC protocol are described at <a href='http://json-rpc.org/wiki/specification' title=''>http://json-rpc.org/wiki/specification</a>.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2.0 version of the JSONRPC protocol are describved at <a href='http://jsonrpc.org/spec.html' title=''>http://jsonrpc.org/spec.html</a>.      
    </p>
    <p>
      JSONHTTP version 1.0 which is not any standard protocol at all. It requires both service name and method name on the url, and in case of HTTP GET also arguments as ?arg=value,... where values are strings or primitives. For POST, PUT, and DELETE a JSON array of values need to be written on the stream.      
    </p>
    <p>
      JSONREST version 1.0 extending JSONHTTP and providing 'true' for <em>supportsREST()</em> which will make the http transport always map methods starting with post, put, get, or delete to the http method. This can thereby deliver a true REST API.
