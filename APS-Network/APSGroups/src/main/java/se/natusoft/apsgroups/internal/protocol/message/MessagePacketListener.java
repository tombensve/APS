 * PROJECT
 *     Name
 *         APS Groups
 *     
 *     Code Version
 *         1.0.0
 *     
 *     Description
 *         Provides network groups where named groups can be joined as members and then send and
 *         receive data messages to the group. This is based on multicast and provides a verified
 *         multicast delivery with acknowledgements of receive to the sender and resends if needed.
 *         The sender will get an exception if not all members receive all data. Member actuality
 *         is handled by members announcing themselves relatively often and will be removed when
 *         an announcement does not come in expected time. So if a member dies unexpectedly
 *         (network goes down, etc) its membership will resolve rather quickly. Members also
 *         tries to inform the group when they are doing a controlled exit. Most network aspects
 *         are configurable. Please note that this does not support streaming! That would require
 *         a far more complex protocol. It waits in all packets of a message before delivering
 *         the message.
 *         
 *         Note that even though this is an OSGi bundle, the jar produced can also be used as a
 *         library outside of OSGi. The se.natusoft.apsgroups.APSGroups API should then be used.
 *         This API has no external dependencies, only this jar is required for that use.
 *         
 *         When run with java -jar a for test command line shell will run where you can check
 *         members, send messages and files.
