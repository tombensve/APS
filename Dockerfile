# This default version of the build in container Dockerfile requires a rerun
# of docker-build/bin/create-build-image.sh after source has been modified.
# This build takes about 11 minutes on my machine. The 'Dockerfile-build-local-fs-in-container'
# sounds like something you would want to do. Such a build however takes an hour.
# So recreateing image saves almost 50 minutes.
