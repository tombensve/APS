# Application Platform Services (APS)

OSGi Application Platform Services - A "smorgasbord" of OSGi services that focuses on ease of use and good enough functionality for many but wont fit all. It can be seen as osgi-ee-light-and-easy. The services are of platform type: configuration, database, JPA, etc, with companion web applications for administration.

All services that require some form of administration have an admin web application for that, that plugs into the general apsadminweb admin web application.

All administrations web applications are WABs and thus require that the OSGi server supports WABs.

Another point of APS is to be as OSGi server independent as possible, but as said above the admin web applications do need support for WABs.

APS is made using basic OSGi functionality and is not using blueprint and other fancy stuff! Each bundle has an activator that does setup, creates trackers, loggers, and manually dependency injects them into the service providers it publishes.

## Features

### Current

*  A far better service tracker that does a better job at handling services coming and going. Supports service availability wait and timeout and can be wrapped as a proxy to the service. Instead of returning null it throws an exception if no service becomes available within the timeout, and is thus much easier to handle.

*  A configuration manager that extends deployed bundles by reading their configuration schema, their default configuration file, and their configuration id, and then loads and publishes an `APSConfig` instance with the bundles configuration. All active configurations are stored in a cluster (vertx/hazelcast). There will be a config web to edit configurations.

*  A filesystem service that provides a persistent filesystem outside of the OSGi server. The configuration service makes use of this to store configurations. Each client can get its own filesystem area, and canÂ´t access anything outside of its area.

*  A platform service that simply identifies the local installation and provides a description of it. It is basically a read only service that provides configured information about the installation.

*  A JPA service that is easier and more clearly defined than the osgi-ee JPA API, and allows for multiple JPA contexts. It works as an extender picking up persistence.xml whose defined persistence unit name can then be looked up using the service. A client can only lookup its own persistence units. It is based on OpenJPA.

*  An administration web service to which administration web applications can register themselves with an url and thus be available in the .../apsadminweb admin gui.

### Planned

*  An implementation of the standard OSGi LogService since not all servers provide one.

*  A log veiwer web application supporting reqular expression filters on log information and a live log view.

*  Anything else relevant I come up with and consider fun to do :-).

### What is new in 

## Pre Setup

The Filesystem service is part of the core and used by other services. It should preferably have its filesystem root outside of the server installation. The BundleContext.getDataFile(String) returns a path within the deploy cache and is only valid for as long a a bundle is deployed. The point with the FilesystemService is to have a more permanent filesystem outside of the application server installation. To provide the FilesystemService root the following system property have to be set and available in the JVM instance:

            aps.filesystem.root=<root>

How to do this differs between servers. In Glassfish you can supply system properties with its admin gui.

If this system property is not set the default root will be BundleContext.getFile(). This can work for development setup, but not for more serious installations!

After this path has been setup and the server started, all other configuration can be done in http://.../apsadminweb/.

# The aps-apis bundle

This contains the general APIs for standard services that other bundles should implement. The APIs are actually one of the main points of APS. Its goal is to define trivially easy to use APIs for different things. Any needed complexity should be hidden within the API implementation and users should only have to deal with the simple API.

The project does provide a lot of implementations of the APIs. They are in 2 categories:

1.  Intended to be deployed and used as is (ex: aps-vertx-provider).

2.  A "default" implementation that can be copied and modified / configured to own need. Of course implementations can also be written from scratch.

For (1) there is of course nothing to stop it from being treated as (2) :-).

The aps-apis bundle also contains some base functionallity like a better service tracker and a generic bundle activator that does depenendy injections. These were previously (<1.0.0) in a separate bundle called aps-tools-lib, but the relationships between that bundle and this finally became too circular so I merged aps-tools-lib into aps-apis.

## Exceptions

APS defines the folowing base exceptions:

*  _APSException_ - The base exception extended by all other APS exceptions. This is a RuntimeException! APS uses no checked exceptions.

*  _APSConfigException_ - Thrown on configuration problems.

*  _APSIOException_ - General IO problems.

*  _APSIOTimeoutException_ - IO timeouts.

*  _APSPersistenceException_ - Persistence problems.

*  _APSResourceNotFoundException_ - Resource problems.

*  _APSStartException_ - Bundle startup problems.

*  _APSUnsupportedException_ - Thrown when something is not supported by a bundle or API implementation. Should be clearly documented.

*  _APSValidationException_ - Thrown on validation failures.

The reason for these are to be able to separate APS specific exceptions from other exceptions if needed.

Also note that much of the APS APIs are reactive with a result callback to an `APSHandler`. These do not throw exceptions, but provides an exception instance in a failure result.

## Tools

### APSServiceTracker

This does the same thing as the standard service tracker included with OSGi, but does it better with more options and flexibility. One of the differences between this tracker and the OSGi one is that this throws an _APSNoServiceAvailableException_ if the service is not available. Personally I think this is easier to work with than having to check for a null result. I also think that trying to keep bundles and services up are better than pulling them down as soon as one depencency goes away for a short while, for example due to redeploy of newer version. This is why APSServiceTracker takes a timeout and waits for a service to come back before failing.

__Note:__ that in previous version APSServiceTracker did all callbacks in a separate thread. This is no longer the case, and shouldn't have been from the beginning.

There are several variants of constructors, but here is an example of one of the most used ones within the APS services:

        APSServiceTracker<Service> tracker =
            new APSServiceTracker<Service>(context, Service.class, "20 seconds");
        tracker.start();

Note that the third argument, which is a timeout can also be specified as an int in which case it is always in miliseconds. The string variant supports the a second word of "sec[onds]" and "min[utes]" which indicates the type of the first numeric value. "forever" means just that and requires just one word. Any other second words than those will be treated as milliseconds. The APSServiceTracker also has a set of constants for the timeout string value:

        public static final String SHORT_TIMEOUT = "3 seconds";
        public static final String MEDIUM_TIMEOUT = "30 seconds";
        public static final String LARGE_TIMEOUT = "2 minutes";
        public static final String VERY_LARGE_TIMEOUT = "5 minutes";
        public static final String HUGE_LARGE_TIMEOUT = "10 minutes";
        public static final String NO_TIMEOUT = "forever";

On bundle stop you should do:

        tracker.stop(context);

So that the tracker unregisters itself from receiving bundle/service events.

#### Services and active service

The tracker tracks all instances of the service being tracked. It however have the notion of an active service. The active service is the service instance that will be returned by allocateService() (which is internally used by all other access methods also). On startup the active service will be the first service instance received. It will keep tracking other instances comming in, but as long as the active service does not go away it will be the one used. If the active service goes away then the the one that is at the beginning of the list of the other tracked instances will become active. If that list is empty there will be no active, which will trigger a wait for a service to become available again if allocateService() is called.

#### Providing a logger

You can provide an APSLogger (see further down about APSLogger) to the tracker:

        tracker.setLogger(apsLogger);

When available the tracker will log to this.

#### Tracker as a wrapped service

The tracker can be used as a wrapped service:

        Service service = tracker.getWrappedService();
        Service service = tracker.getWrappedService(boolean cacheCallsUntilServiceAvailable);

This gives you a proxied _service_ instance that gets the real service, calls it, releases it and return the result. This handles transparently if a service has been restarted or one instance of the service has gone away and another came available. It will wait for the specified timeout for a service to become available and if that does not happen the _APSNoServiceAvailableException_ will be thrown. This is of course a runtime exception which makes the service wrapping possible without loosing the possibility to handle the case where the service is not available.

The _cacheCallsUntilServiceAvailable_ parameter means just that. This makes the service non blocking. Otherwise any call to a method when service is not available will result in a wait() on the thread until a service is available. When this parameter is `true` however any calls to the service before a service is available will be cached and executed later when a service is available. Do note that the tracker wrapper provides a java.lang.reflect.Proxy implementation of the service interface. Under the surface it will do an _invoke_ on the actual service object and this invoke can be saved for later in a lambda. There is however a big __warning__ with this: This feature will obviously only work for methods that don't provide a return value! Since method calls may possible be done in the future they cannot return any value. And no, _Future<?>_ cannot be used since it blocks, and we are trying to avoid blocking here!

If you don't like this, don't use the _getWrappedService(true)_. The _.onActiveServiceAvailable(callback)_ method can be used to receive the service instance when it is available.

#### Using the tracker in a similar way to the OSGi standard tracker

To get a service instance you do:

        Service service = tracker.allocateService();

Note that if the tracker has a timeout set then this call will wait for the service to become available if it is currently not available until an instance becomes available or the timeout time is reached. It will throw _APSNoServiceAvailableException_ on failure in any case.

When done with the service do:

        tracker.releaseService();

#### Accessing a service by tracker callback

Note that the _onServiceAvailable_, _onServiceLeaving_, etc have historical reasons for the names, but do now accept multiple calls without overwriting previous callback. The reason for this is that __APSActivator__ reuses a tracker instance for tracking the same service in different classes. This allow for each class to do an _onServiceAvailable(...)_ and be called back when service is available. The easiest use of __APSServiceTracker__ & __APSActivator__ is to inject tracker as a proxied instance of the service API, by declaring its type to be the service interface. There are however times when you need to know when a service is available and this provides that.

There are a few variants to get a service instance by callback. When the callbacks are used the actual service instance will only be allocated during the callback and then released again.

##### onServiceAvailable

This will result in a callback when any instance of the service becomes available. If there is more than one service instance published then there will be a callback for each.

            tracker.onServiceAvailable(new OnServiceAvailable<Service>() {
                @Override
                public void onServiceAvailable(
                    Service service,
                    ServiceReference serviceReference
                ) throws Exception {
                    // Do something.
                }
            });

##### onServiceLeaving

This will result in a callback when any instance of the service goes away. If there is more than one service instance published the there will be a callback for each instance leaving.

            onServiceLeaving(new OnServiceLeaving<Service>() {
        
                @Override
                public void onServiceLeaving(
                    ServiceReference service,
                    Class serviceAPI
                ) throws Exception {
                    // Handle the service leaving.
                }
            });

Note that since the service is already gone by this time you don't get the service instance, only its reference and the class representing its API. In most cases both of these parameters are irellevant.

##### onActiveServiceAvailable

This does the same thing as onServiceAvailable() but only for the active service. It uses the same _OnServiceAvailable_ interface.

##### onActiveServiceLeaving

This does the same thing as onServiceLeaving() but for the active service. It uses the same _OnServiceLeaving_ interface.

##### withService

Runs the specified callback providing it with a service to use. This will wait for a service to become available if a timeout has been provided for the tracker.

Don't use this in an activator start() method! onActiveServiceAvailable() and onActiveServiceLeaving() are safe in a start() method, this is not!

            tracker.withService(new WithService<Service>() {
                @Override
                public void withService(
                    Service service,
                    Object... args
                ) throws Exception {
                    // do something here.
                }
            }, arg1, arg2);

If you don't have any arguments this will also work:

            tracker.withService(new WithService<Service>() {
                @Override
                public void withService(
                    Service service
                ) throws Exception {
                    // do something here
                }
            });

##### withServiceIfAvailable

This does the same as withService(...) but without waiting for a service to become available. If the service is not available at the time of the call the callback will not be called. No exception is thrown by this!

##### withAllAvailableServices

This is used exactly the same way as withService(...), but the callback will be done for each tracked service instance, not only the active.

##### onTimeout (since 0.9.3)

This allows for a callback when the tracker times out waiting for a service. This callback will be called just before the _APSNoServiceAvailableException_ is about to be thrown.

        tracker.onTimeout(new OnTimeout() {
            @Override
            public void onTimeout() {
                // do something here
            }
        });

### APSLogger

This provides logging functionality. The no args constructor will log to System.out by default. The OutputStream constructor will logg to the specified output stream by default.

The APSLogger can be used by just creating an instance and then start using the info(...), error(...), etc methods. But in that case it will only log to System.out or the provided OutputStream. If you however do this:

        APSLogger logger = new APSLogger();
        logger.start(context);

then the logger will try to get hold of the standard OSGi LogService and if that is available log to that. If the log service is not available it will fallback to the OutputStream.

If you call the _setServiceRefrence(serviceRef);_ method on the logger then information about that service will be provied with each log.

### APSActivator

This is a BundleActivator implementation that uses annotations to register services and inject tracked services. Any bundle can use this activator by just importing the _se.natusoft.osgi.aps.activator_ and _se.natusoft.osgi.aps.activator.annotation_ packages.

This is actually a rather trivial class that just scans the bundle for classes and inspects all classes for annotations and act on them.

__Please note__ that it does _class.getDeclaredFields()_ and _class.getDeclaredMethods()_! This means that it will only see the bottom class of an inheritance hiearchy!

The following annotations are available:

__@OSGiServiceProvider__ - This should be specified on a class that implements a service interface and should be registered as an OSGi service. _Please note_ that the first declared implemented interface is used as service interface unless you specify serviceAPIs={Svc.class, ...}.

        public @interface OSGiProperty {
            String name();
            String value();
        }
        
        public @interface OSGiServiceInstance {
        
            /** Extra properties to register the service with. */
            OSGiProperty[] properties() default {};
        
            /**
             * The service API to register instance with. If not specified the first
             * implemented interface will be used.
             */
            Class[] serviceAPIs() default {};
        }
        
        public @interface OSGiServiceProvider {
            /** Extra properties to register the service with. */
            OSGiProperty[] properties() default {};
        
            /**
             * The service API to register instance with. If not specified the first
             * implemented interface will be used.
             */
            Class[] serviceAPIs() default {};
        
            /**
             * This can be used as an alternative to properties() and also supports
             * several instances.
             */
            OSGiServiceInstance[] instances() default {};
        
            /**
             * An alternative to providing static information. This class will be
             * instantiated if specified and provideServiceInstancesSetup() will
             * be called to provide implemented service APIs, service properties,
             * and a service instance. In this last, it differs from
             * instanceFactoryClass() since that does not provide an instance.
             * This allows for more easy configuration of each instance.
             */
            Class<? extends APSActivatorServiceSetupProvider>
                serviceSetupProvider()
                default APSActivatorServiceSetupProvider.class;
        
            /**
             * This can be used as an alternative and will instantiate the
             * specified factory class which will deliver one set of
             * Properties per instance.
             */
            Class<? extends APSActivator.InstanceFactory> instanceFactoryClass()
                default APSActivator.InstanceFactory.class;
        
            /**
             * If true this service will be started in a separate thread.
             * This means the bundle start will continue in parallel and
             * that any failures in startup will be logged, but will
             * not stop the bundle from being started. If this is true
             * it wins over required service dependencies of the service
             * class. Specifying this as true allows you to do things that
             * cannot be done in a bunde activator start method, like
             * calling a service tracked by APSServiceTracker, without
             * causing a deadlock.
             */
            boolean threadStart() default false;
        }

Do note that for the _serviceSetupProvider()_ another solution is to use the _@BundleStart_ (see below) and just create instances of your service and register them with the BundleContext. But if you use _@OSGiServiceProvider_ to instantiate and register other "one instance" services, then using _serviceSetupProvider()_ would look a bit more consistent.

__@APSExternalizabe__, __@APSRemoteService__ - These 2 annotations are synonyms and have no properties. They should be used on a service implementation class. When either of these are specified the "aps-externalizable=true" property will be set when the service is registered with the OSGi container. The APSExternalProtocolExtender will react on this property and make the service externally accessible.

__@OSGiService__ - This should be specified on a field having a type of a service interface to have a service of that type injected, and continuously tracked. Any call to the service will throw an APSNoServiceAvailableException (runtime) if no service has become available before the specified timeout. It is also possible to have APSServiceTracker as field type in which case the underlying configured tracker will be injected instead.

If _required=true_ is specified and this field is in a class annotated with _@OSGiServiceProvider_ then the class will not be registered as a service until the service dependency is actually available, and will also be unregistered if the tracker for the service does a timeout waiting for a service to become available. It will then be reregistered again when the dependent service becomes available again. Please note that unlike iPOJO the bundle is never stopped on dependent service unavailability, only the actual service is unregistered as an OSGi service. A bundle might have more than one service registered and when a dependency that is only required by one service goes away the other service is still available.

The non blocking variant of _APSServiceTracker.getWrappedService(true)_ as described above can also be achieved with this annotation by setting _nonBlocking = true_.

        public @interface OSGiService {
        
            /**
             * The timeout for a service to become available. Defaults
             * to 30 seconds.
             */
            String timeout() default "30 seconds";
        
            /**
             * Any additional search criteria. Should start with
             * '(' and end with ')'. Defaults to none.
             */
            String additionalSearchCriteria() default "";
        
            /**
             * This should specify a Class implementing
             * APSActivatorSearchCriteriaProvider. If specified it will
             * be used instead of additionalSearchCriteria() by
             * instantiating the Class and calling its method to get
             * a search criteria back. This allows for search criteria
             * coming from configuration, which a static annotation String
             * does not.
             */
            Class<? extends APSActivatorSearchCriteriaProvider>
                searchCriteriaProvider()
                default APSActivatorSearchCriteriaProvider.class;
        
            /**
             * If set to true the service using this service will not
             * be registered until the service becomes available.
             */
            boolean required() default false;
        
            /**
             * If this is set to true and a proxied implementation of the service is injected rather than the tracker directly

             *
             * @return true or false (default).
             */
            boolean nonBlocking() default false;
        }

__@Managed__ - This will have an instance managed and injected. There will be a unique instance for each name specified with the default name of "default" being used if none is specified. There are 2 field types handled specially: BundleContext and APSLogger. A BundleContext field will get the bundles context injected. For an APSLogger instance the 'loggingFor' annotation property can be specified. Please note that any other type must have a default constructor to be instantiated and injected!

        public @interface Managed {
        
            /**
             * The name of the instance to inject. If the same is used
             * in multiple classes the same instance will be injected.
             */
            String name() default "default";
        
            /**
             * A label indicating who is logging. If not specified the
             * bundle name will be used. This is only
             * relevant if the injected type is APSLogger.
             */
            String loggingFor() default "";
        }

__@ExecutorSvc__ - This should always be used in conjunction with @Managed! This also assumes that the annotated field is of type ExecutorService or ScheduledExecutorService. This annotation provides some configuration for the ExecutorService that will be injected.

        @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
        @Target(ElementType.FIELD)
        public @interface ExecutorSvc {
        
            enum ExecutorType {
                FixedSize,
                WorkStealing,
                Single,
                Cached,
                Scheduled,
                SingleScheduled
            }
        
            /** This is loosely the number of concurrent threads. */
            int parallelism() default 10;
        
            /** The type of ExecutorService wanted. */
            ExecutorType type() default ExecutorType.FixedSize;
        
            /** If true the created ExecutorService will be wrapped with a delegate that disallows configuration. */
            boolean unConfigurable() default false;
        }

__@Schedule__ - Schedules a Runnable using a ScheduledExecutionService. Indifferent from @ExecutorSvc this does not require an @Managed also, but do work with @Managed if that is used to inject an instance of Runnable to be scheduled. @Schedule is handled after all injections have been done.

TODO: Since APS is nowmore built on top of vertx, servlets no longer need to be supported. Vaadin (traditional) is not supported either due to requiring servlets. Vaadin web components that works with Angular and React is however supported.

#### Usage as BundleActivator

The _APSActivator_ class has 2 constructors. The default constructor without arguments are used for BundleActivator usage. In this case you just specify this class as your bundles activator, and then use the annotations described above. Thats it!

#### Other Usage

Since the activator usage will manage and create instances of all annotated classes this will not always work in all situations. One example is web applications where the web container is responsible for creating servlets. If you specifiy APSActivator as an activator for a WAB bundle and then use the annotations in a servlet then APSActivator will have a managed instance of the servlet, but it will not be the same instance as the web contatiner will run.

Therefore APSActivator has another constructor that takes a vararg of instances: `public APSActivator(Object...``instances)`. There is also a `public void addManagedInstance(Object instance)` method. These allow you to add an already existing instance to be managed by APSActivator. In addition to the provided existing instances it will still scan the bundle for classes to manage. It will however not double manage any class for which an existing instance of has already been provided. Any annotated class for which existing instances has not been provided will be instantiated by APSActivator.

__Please note__ that if you create an instance of APSActivator in a servlet and provide the servlet instance to it and start it (you still need to do _start(BundleContext)_ and _stop(BundleContext)_ when used this way!), then you need to catch the close of the servlet and do _stop_ then.

There are 2 support classes:

*  [APSVaadinWebTools]: APSVaadinOSGiApplication - This is subclassed by your Vaading application.

*  [APSWebTools]: APSOSGiSupport - You create an instance of this in a servlet and let your servlet implement the _APSOSGiSupportCallbacks_ interface which is then passed to the constructor of APSOSGiSupport.

Both of these creates and manages an APSActivator internally and catches shutdown to take it down. They also provide other utilities like providing the BundleContext. See _APSWebTools_ for more information.

#### APSActivatorPlugin

Any implementing classes of this interface can be specified in META-INF/services/se.natusoft.osgi.aps.tools.APSActivatorPlugin file, one per line. These are loaded by java.util.ServiceLoader. The implementation can be provided by another bundle which should then export the relevant packages which can then be imported in the using bundle.

The APSActivatorPlugin API looks like this:

        public interface APSActivatorPlugin {
        
            interface ActivatorInteraction {
                void addManagedInstance(Object instance, Class forClass);
            }
        
            void analyseBundleClass(ActivatorInteraction activatorInteraction, Class bundleClass);
        }

__Be warned__ that this is currently very untested! No APS code uses this yet.

### APSContextWrapper

This provides a static wrap(...) method:

        Service providedService = APSContextWrapper.wrap(serviceProvider, Service.class);

where _serviceProvider_ is an instance of a class that implements _Service_. The resulting instance is a java.lang.reflect.Proxy implementation of _Service_ that ensures that the _serviceProvider_ ClassLoader is the context class loader during each call to all service methods that are annotated with @APSRunInBundlesContext annotation in _Service_. The wrapped instance can then be registered as the OSGi service provider.

Normally the threads context class loader is the original service callers context class loader. For a web application it would be the web containers context class loader. If a service needs its own bundles class loader during its execution then this wrapper can be used.

### ID generators

There is one interface:

        /**
         * This is a generic interface for representing IDs.
         */
        public interface ID extends Comparable<ID> {
        
            /**
             * Creates a new unique ID.
             *
             * @return A newly created ID.
             */
            public ID newID();
        
            /**
             * Tests for equality.
             *
             * @param obj The object to compare with.
             *
             * @return true if equal, false otherwise.
             */
            @Override
            public boolean equals(Object obj);
        
            /**
             * @return The hash code.
             */
            @Override
            public int hashCode();
        
        }

that have 2 implementations:

*  IntID - Produces int ids.

*  UUID - Produces java.util.UUID Ids.

### Javadoc

The javadoc for this can be found at [http://apidoc.natusoft.se/APSToolsLib/](http://apidoc.natusoft.se/APSToolsLib/).

## APSConfigManager

This bunlde listens for other bundles and checks for the following MANIFEST.MF entries:

*  `APS-Config-Id` A unique id for a configuration to manage.

*  `APS-Config-Schema` Points to a bundle relative JSON file containing an APS JSON schema, describing the configuration file. See aps-core-lib documentation for more information on the schema format.

*  `APS-Config-Default-Resource` Points to a bundle relative JSON file folowing the schema and containging default configuration values.

For each bundle with an `APS-Config-Id` an instance of `APSConfig` is created loaded with current config from disk or cluster, or the default config file. If the config is new and has no previous configuration stored then the contents of the default configuration will be stored.

The created `APSConfig` is then published as an OSGi service and the following lookup property: `(apsConfigId=<config id>)`.

There are 2 ways to get configuration:

Since the configuration is published as an OSGi "service", a service tracker can be used to look it up. The APSServiceTracker has some special features that makes it easier and it can also be provided by APSActivator:

        @OSGiService( additionalSearchCriteria = "(apsConfigId=my-config-id)", nonBlocking = true )
        private APSServiceTracker<APSConfig> configTracker
        
        @Managed
        private BundleContext context
        
        private APSConfig config
        
        @Initializer
        void init() {
            this.configTracker.onActiveServiceAvailable { APSConfig config, ServiceReference configRef ->
                this.config = this.context.getService(configRef);
                ...
            }
        
            this.configTracker.onActiveServiceLeaving { ServiceReference configRef, Class type ->
                this.config = null
                ...
            }
            ...
        }

Note that the first argument which actually is the APSConfig instance you want, cannot be saved. It only exists within the callback block. Thereby we must allocate a new usage by using the OSGi BundleContext to get it. This should of course be released again when your code no longer needs the configuration object.

The other and easier way to get configuration is to let APSActivator give it to you:

        private APSConfig config
        
        @ConfigListener(apsConfigId = "my-config-id")
        void config( APSConfig config ) {
            if (config != null) {
                this.config = config
                ...
            }
            else {
                this.config = null
            }
        }

This is much easier, but actually does the same as the first example. The difference is that APSActivator does it for you. Note that the method will be called with a null value if the configuration is unpublished as an OSGi service! This will however only happen if the config is unpublished before aps-config-manager and the listening bundle shuts down. So basically your code must expect and handle a null, but cannot demand to allways get a null on shutdown.

Note that in both these cases you wait for the configuration to become available. The following would also be possible and can seem simpler:

        @OSGiService
        private APSConfig config

But in this case you will be blocking the thread if it is accessed before it is available. If this was done in code called from bundle activator then there would be a problem! The other two ways are completely non blocking and reactive in that you get it when it is available.

Whatever the code is doing, it can start doing it when the config is available. If it needs to do something that isn't quick, then it should work in another thread since the config listener call made by APSActivator needs to return rather quickly. Here is a suggestion: `APSExecutor.submit { ...``}`. This will then be submitted to a thread pool with as many threads as there are cores in the machine. APSActivator can also inject an `ExecutionService` that is backed by a thread pool for use by the bundle only. `APSExecutor` provides one thread pool for all bundles to share and are intended for shorter jobs.

### MapJSON

Configurations are JSON documents. `APSConfig`extends `Map<String,``Object>` and can thus be used as a Map representation of the JSON data, but it also has `lookup(String key)` method that takes a structured key (implemented by StructMap from aps-core-lib) to lookup a value. There is also a `provide( String structPath,``Object value )` method that is intended for configuration editors to use to update config values. An update of config value will update cluster and inform other nodes of the change. See documentation for StructMap in aps-core-lib for more information.

# APSFilesystemService

This provides a filesystem for writing and reading files. This filesystem resides outside of the OSGi server and is for longterm storage, which differs from BundleContext.getDataFile() which resides within bundle deployment. The APSFilesystemService also does not return a File object! It priovides a file area for each unique owner name that is accessed through an API that cannot navigate nor access any files outside of this area. The âownerâ name should be either an application name or a bundle name if it is only used by one bundle.

The APSConfigService uses the APSFilesystemService to store its configurations.

## Setup

The _aps.filesystem.root_ system property must be set to point to a root where this service provides its file areas. This is either passed to the JVM at server startup or configured withing the server. Glassfish allows you to configure properties within its admin gui. Virgo does not. If this is not provided the service will use BundleContext.getDataFile(".") as the root, which will work for testing and playing around, but should not be used for more serious purposes since this is not a path with a long term availability.

## The service

The service allows you to create or get an APSFilesystem object. From that object you can create/read/delete directories (represented by APSDirectory) and files (represented by APSFile). You can get readers, writers, input streams and output streams from files. All paths are relative to the file area represented by the APSFilesystem object.

The javadoc for the [APSFilesystemService](http://apidoc.natusoft.se/APS/se/natusoft/osgi/aps/api/core/filesystem/service/APSFilesystemService.html).

## The APIs for this service

public _interface_ __APSFile__   [se.natusoft.osgi.aps.api.core.filesystem.model] {

This represents a file in an _APSFilesystemService_ provided filesystem. It provides most of the API of _java.io.File_ but is not a _java.io.File_! It never discloses the full path in the host filesystem, only paths relative to its _APSFilesystem_ root.

Use the createInputStream/OutputStream/Reader/Writer to read and write the file.

# APSJSONLib

This is a library (exports all its packages and provides no service) for reading and writing JSON. It can also write a JavaBean object as JSON and take a JSON value or inputstream containing JSON and produce a JavaBean.

This basically provides a class representing each JSON type: JSONObject, JSONString, JSONNumber, JSONBoolean, JSONArray, JSONNull, and a JSONValue class that is the common base class for all the other. Each class knows how to read and write the JSON type it represents. Then there is a JavaToJSON and a JSONToJava class with static methods for converting back and forth. This mapping is very primitive. There has to be one to one between the JSON and the Java objects.

## Changes

### 0.10.0

_readJSON(...)_ in the __JSONValue__ base class now throws JSONEOFException (extends IOException) on EOF. The reason for this is that internally it reads characters which cannot return -1 or any non JSON data valid char to represent EOF. Yes, it would be possible to replace _char_ with _Character_, but that will have a greater effect on existing code using this lib. If an JSONEOFException comes and is not handled it is still very much more clear what happened than a NullPointerException would be!

## APIs

Complete javadocs can be found at [http://apidoc.natusoft.se/APSJSONLib/](http://apidoc.natusoft.se/APSJSONLib/).

public _class_ __JSONConvertionException__ extends  RuntimeException    [se.natusoft.osgi.aps.json] {

This exception is thrown on failure to convert from JSON to Java or Java to JSON.

Almost all exceptions within the APS services and libraries extend either _APSException_ or _APSRuntimeException_. I decided to just extend RuntimeException here to avoid any other dependencies for this library since it can be useful outside of APS and can be used as any jar if not deployed in OSGi container.

__public JSONConvertionException(final String message)__

# aps-core-lib

## MapJsonDocValidator

This takes a schema (made up of a `Map<String,``Object>`, see below) and another `Map<String,``Object>` representing the JSON. So the catch here is that you need a JSON parser that allows you to get the content as a Map. The Vertx JSON parser does. This uses `Map` since it is generic, does not need to hardcode dependency on a specific parser, and maps are very easy to work with in Groovy.

### Useage

             private Map<String, Object> schema = [
                    "header_?": "Contains meta data about the message.",
                    "header_1": [
                            "type_?"      : "The type of the message. Currently only 'service'.",
                            "type_1"      : "service",
                            "address_?"   : "The address of the sender.",
                            "address_1"   : "?aps\\.admin\\..*",
                            "classifier_1": "?public|private"
                    ],
                    "body_1"  : [
                            "action_1": "get-webs"
                    ],
                    "reply_0": [
                            "webs_1": [
                                    [
                                            "name_1": "?.*",
                                            "url_1": "?^https?://.*",
                                            "no1_0": "#1-100",
                                            "no2_0": "#<=10",
                                            "no3_0": "#>100",
                                            "no4_0": "#1.2-3.4"
                                    ]
                            ]
                    ]
            ] as Map<String, Object>
        
            private MapJsonDocValidator verifier = new MapJsonDocValidator( validStructure: schema )
        
            ...
        
            verifier.validate(myJsonMap)

This will throw a runtime exception on validation failure, specifically APSValidationException.

Note that there is also a special feature for defining a simple dynamic key=>value map where the key is defined with a regexp and the value can be a regexp, string, number, or boolean. This is done be defining a map with only one entry. Example:

        private Map<String, Object> schema = [
            "nameAddress": [
                "?([a-z]|[0-9]|_|-)+": "?[0-9,.]+"
            ]
        ]

In this case `nameAdress` can contain any number of entries as long as each entry have a key containging a-z or 0-9 or _ or - and there must be at least one character, and the value only contains numbers and dots.

Note that when the key is a regexp (starts with '?') then there can be no more rule for this submap!

### Schema

#### Keys

<key>_0 - The key is optional.

<key>_1 - The key is required.

<key>_? - A description of the key. MapJsonSchemaMeta extracts this information. It is intended for editors editing data of a file validated by a schema. This should provide help information about the value. Since APS uses the MapJsonDocSchemaValidator for configurations and is intended to have web guis for editing configuration this is intended to provide information about configuration fields.

?regexp - special handling. See usage above.

#### Values

##### "?regexp"

The '?' indicates that the rest of the value is a regular expression. This regular expression will be applied to each value.

##### "<hash><range>"

This indicates that this is a number and defines the number range allowed. The following variants are available:

__"#from-to"__ : This specifies a range of allowed values, from lowest to highest.

__"#<=num"__ : This specifies that the numeric value must be less than or equal to the specified number.

__"#>=num"__ : This specifies that the numeric value must be larger than or equal to the specified number.

__"#<num"__ : This specifies that the numeric value must be less than the specified number.

__"#>num"__ : This specifies that the numeric value must be larger than the specified number.

Note: Both floating point numbers and integers are allowed.

##### "bla"

This requires values to be exactly "bla".

#### Example

        Map<String, Object> myJsonObject = JSON.readJsonAsMap( myJsonStream, jsonErrorHandler)
        ...
        
        Map<String, object> schema = JSON.readJsonAsMap(schemaStream, jsonErrorHandler)
        MapJsonDocValidator jsonValidator = new MapJsonDocValidator( validstructure: schema )
        
        jsonValidator.validate( myJsonObject )

## MapJsonSchemaMeta

This class scans a MapJson schema as defined by MapJsonDocValidator and extracts a list of MapJsonEntryMeta instances for each value in a MapJson structure living up to the schema.

From these the following can be resolved:

*  The name of a value.

*  The type of a value.

*  Is the value required ?

*  The constraints of the value. If this starts with '?' then the rest is a regular expression.  If not the value is a constant, that is, the value has to be exactly as the constraint string.

*  A description of the value.

This is not used by the MapJsonDocValidator when validating! This is intended for GUI configuration editors to use to build a configuration GUI producing valid configurations.

Usage:

        Map<String, Object> schema
        ...
        new MapJsonSchemaMeta(schema).mapJsonEntryMetas.each { MapJsonEntryMeta mjem -> ... }

## StructMap

This wraps a structured Map that looks like a JSON document, containing Map, List, and other 'Object's as values.

A key is a String containing branches separated by '.' characters for each sub structure.

It provides a method to collect all value referencing keys in the map structure with full key paths.

It provides a lookup method that takes a full value key path and returns a value.

Note that since this delegates to the wrapped Map the class is also a Map when compiled!

Here is an example (in Groovy) that shows how to lookup and how to use the keys:

        StructMap smap = new StructMap<>(
                [
                        header: [
                                type      : "service",
                                address   : "aps.admin.web",
                                classifier: "public",
                                enabled   : true
                        ],
                        body  : [
                                action: "get-webs"
                        ],
                        reply : [
                                webs: [
                                        [
                                                name: "ConfigAdmin",
                                                url : "http://localhost:8080/aps/ConfigAdminWeb",
                                        ],
                                        [
                                                name: "RemoteServicesAdmin",
                                                url : "https://localhost:8080/aps/RemoteSvcAdmin"
                                        ]
                                ]
                        ]
                ] as Map<String, Object>
        ) as StructMap
        
        assert smap.lookup( "header.type" ).toString() == "service"
        assert smap.lookup( "header.address" ).toString() == "aps.admin.web"
        assert smap.lookup( "header.classifier" ).toString() == "public"
        assert smap.lookup( "body.action" ).toString() == "get-webs"
        assert smap.lookup( "reply.webs.[0].name") == "ConfigAdmin"
        assert smap.lookup( "reply.webs.[1].name") == "RemoteServicesAdmin"
        assert smap.lookup( "reply.webs.[1].url") == "https://localhost:8080/aps/RemoteSvcAdmin"
        
        smap.withAllKeys { String key ->
            println "${key}"
        }
        
        // will produce:
        header.type
        header.address
        header.classifier
        header.enabled
        body.action
        reply.webs.[2].name
        reply.webs.[2].url

Note that the values are API-wise of type Object! This is because it can be anything, like a String, Map, List, Number (if you stick to JSON formats) or any other type of value you put in there.

Also note the indexes in the keys in the example. It is not "webs[0]" but "webs.[0]"! The index is a reference name in itself. The keys returned by getAllKeys() have a number between the '[' and the ']' for List entries. This number is the number of entries in the list. The StructPath class (used by this class) can be used to provide array size of an array value.

# APSJPAService

This provides JPA to services and applications. It has a slightly more OSGi friendly API than the org.osgi.service.jpa.EntityManagerFactoryBuilder. The APSOpenJPAProvider however returns an APSJPAService instance that also implements EntityManagerFactoryBuilder. For some reason I havenât figured out yet, it cannot be registered as a service with the EntityManagerFactoryBuilder interface! The bundle fails to deploy if that is done.

The provided service is using OpenJPA. The service works partly as an extender inspecting deployed bundles for a META-INF/persistence.xml file. When found this is read and some setup is done already there. The persistenceUnitName from the persistence.xml file is used to connect the client later with its configuration. When a JPA using bundle is shut down its JPA setup is automatically cleaned.

Here is an example of usage:

            private APSJPAEntityManagerProvider emp = null;
            ...
            private APSJPAEntityManagerProvider getEMP() {
                if (this.emp == null || !this.emp.isValid()) {
                    DataSourceDef dsDef = this.dataSourceDefService.lookupByName(âMyDS");
                    if (dsDef == null) {
                        throw new SomeException("Could not find an âMyDsâ in 'persistence/datasources' configuration!");
                    }
                    Map<String, String> props = new HashMap<String, String>();
                    props.put("javax.persistence.jdbc.user", dsDef.getConnectionUserName());
                    props.put("javax.persistence.jdbc.password", dsDef.getConnectionPassword());
                    props.put("javax.persistence.jdbc.url", dsDef.getConnectionURL());
                    props.put("javax.persistence.jdbc.driver", dsDef.getConnectionDriveName());
                    this.emp = this.jpaService.initialize(this.bundleContext, âmyPersistenceUnitNameâ, props);
                }
                return this.emp;
            }
            ...
            EntityManager em = getEMP().createEntityManager();
            em.getTransaction().begin();
        
            try {
                RoleEntity role = new RoleEntity(id);
                role.setDescription(description);
                em.persist(role);
                em.getTransaction().commit();
            }
            catch (RuntimeException re) {
                em.getTransaction().rollback();
                throw re;
            }
            finally {
                em.close();
            }
                

This code example handles the APSJPAService having been restared or redeployed. When `emp.isValid()` returns false then all you need to do is to call `jpaService.initialize(...)` again. The rest is just POJPA (Plain Old JPA :-)).

## APIs

public _interface_ __APSJPAService__   [se.natusoft.osgi.aps.api.data.jpa.service] {

This service allows an JPA _EntityManager_ to be gotten for a persistent unit name.

So why is this done this way ? Why is not an _EntityManagerFactory_ returned?

The answer to that is that the _EntityManagerFactory_ is internal to the service who is responsible for creating it and for closing it at sometime (stopping of bundle). The client only needs an _EntityManager_ for which the client is responsible after its creation.

The creation of the _EntityManagerFactory_ is delayed until the call to _initialize(...)_. Creating the EMF along with the persistence provider at persistence bundle discovery would limit database connection properties to the persistence.xml file which is less than optimal to put it mildly. This way a client can make use of the _APSDataSourceDefService_ to get the JDBC properties which it can pass along to this service.

The default provider implementation of this service uses OpenJPA which provides its own connection pooling.

__APSJPAEntityManagerProvider initialize(BundleContext bundleContext, String persistenceUnitName, Map<String, String> props) throws APSResourceNotFoundException__

Initializes and returns a provider from the specified properties.

_Returns_

> A configured EntityManager.

_Parameters_

> _bundleContext_ - The context of the client bundle. It is used to locate its persistence provider. 

> _persistenceUnitName_ - The name of the persistent unit defined in persistence.xml. 

> _props_ - Custom properties to configure database, etc. 



__boolean isValid()__

Returns true if this instance is valid. If not call APSJPAService.initialize(...) again to get a new instance. It will be invalid if the APSJPAService provider have been restarted.

__EntityManager createEntityManager()__

Creates a new _EntityManager_. You are responsible for closing it!

Please note that the _EntityManager_ caches all referenced entities. If you keep and reuse it for a longer time it can use more memory. For example at [http://docs.jboss.org/ejb3/app-server/tutorial/extended_pc/extended.html](http://docs.jboss.org/ejb3/app-server/tutorial/extended_pc/extended.html) it says that "Usually, an _EntityManager_ in JBoss EJB 3.0 lives and dies within a JTA transaction". This indicates how long-lived the _EntityManager_ should preferably be.

_Returns_

> A configured EntityManager.

__EntityManagerFactory getEntityManagerFactory()__

Returns the underlying _EntityManagerFactory_. This will return null if isValid() return false!

Be very careful what you do with this! It is managed by this service!

# APS RabbitMQ Message Service Provider

This service provides an implementation of APSMessageService using [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/).

__Note:__ This implementation does not support _contentType_ in the API. When sending messages the _contentType_ will be ignored, and when messages are received the _contentType_ will always be "UNKNOWN".

A good suggestion is to always use JSON or XML as content.

## APSMessageService API

[Javadoc](http://apidoc.natusoft.se/APS/se/natusoft/osgi/aps/api/net/messaging/service/APSMessageService.html)

## aps-vertx-event-bus-messaging-provider

This publishes 3 services: `MessagePublisher`, `MessageSender`, and `MessageSubscriber`.

Each of these use Vertx EventBus under the surface. These messages are not persistent and are sent within a Vertx cluster.

The difference between publisher and sender is that publisher sends to everyone listening on the destination, while sender only sends to one. Vertx uses round robin for sender to spread out to nodes in the cluster.

The aps-vertx-provider also publishes the EventBus instance as a service, which is what this implementation is using. The EventBus can of course be used directly instead of this service. This service uses the official APS messaging API and thus all kinds of messaging can be done in the same way. It is also in general a good idea encapsulate the real implementation so that it is easy to change to something else if needed/wanted in the future. This service provides that.

For more information on Vertx see: [http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/groovy/](http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/groovy/)

### Lookup

This properties for all 3 services contains:

        aps-protocol-name:    vertx-eventbus
        service-category:     network
        service-function:     messaging
        messaging-persistent: false
        messaging-clustered:  true
        service-provider:     aps-vertx-event-bus-messaging-provider:publisher/sender/subscriber

# Web Manager

## Components

The components are mostly based on React-Bootstrap components. The APS components wrap other components to provide components that connect to a common bus. All relevant component events are are sent as messages on the bus. No code has to attach listeners to specific components. Any code that wants to react to a component being triggered does so by joining the bus and listen to messages. So the code reacting on messages really has no direct association with any component, they just react to messages.

All components has a listenTo and a sendTo property which points out and address to send or listen to. Most components only send messages.

This separation of component rendering code and event handler code makes it rather easy to render components after a JSON specification. That is what WebManager does. It listens for a JSON GUI spec on the bus, and when it sees such, it renders it. When a user interacts with the rendered GUI messges will be sent on the bus.

## APSEventBus

On the frontend there is a local `APSEventBus` that is used to send and receive messages. This is basically a wrapper. It does not do anything other than pass on to 'EventBusRouter's. There are 2 'EventBusRouter's: `APSLocalEventBusRouter`and `APSVertxEventBusRouter`. These are both added to `APSEventBus`.

### APSLocalEventBusRouter

This looks at the header of a message and if _routing_ contains _client_ then it passes the message to all registered local subscribers. This never goes out on the network, it only works internatlly in the client. This is used to communicate between different components locally.

### APSVertxEventBusRouter

This looks at the header of a message and if _routing_ contains _backend_ it does a send on the Vert.x client event bus bridge. A send does a round robin to to listeners of specified address. If _routing_ contains _cluster_ it does a publish on the Vert.x client event bus bridge. This goes to all listeners of the address in the whole cluster, including other clients.

## Messaging

A note: _Vert.x uses Hazelcast by default to handle the cluster.__Hazelcast by default manages a cluster on the same subnet only,__by multicast.__Hazelcast can of course be configured to create larger clusters.__But that is a Hazelcast thing,__not APS nor Vert.x._

### Addresses

Each message must be addressed! An address is just a string. It can be anything. If you send to an address it will be received if there is something also listening to exactly the same address. See an address as a group name as is common in other messaging solutions.

As said above when a send is done on the Vert.x event bus it does a round robin between each listener of the "sent to" address. This to support load balancing.

#### Address Strategy

Note: (app) refers to a specific application as a wildcard, and (UUID) refers to a generated UUID value.

From __client perspective__:

*  Client

   *  "aps:(app):client:(UUID)"

      *  Network: listen

      *  Local: listen, send

*  Backend

   *  "aps:(app):backend"

      *  Network: send

*  Cluster

   *  "aps:(app):all" : Every backend and client of (app).

      *  Network: listen, send

   *  "aps:(app):all:backend" : Every backend of (app).

      *  Network: send

   *  "aps:(app):all:client" : Every client of (app).

      *  Network: listen, send

__Note 1:__ Only clients have a unique address. They are the only ones that needs a unique address due to being the only unique thing.

__Note 2:__ Vert.x does a round robin on "send" to same address. Only backend messages are delivered with a send. All cluster messages are delived with a "publish" and will always go to every subscriber.

__Note 3:__ Both on client side and on backend, code is not interacting with the Vert.x bus, but local busses with message routers. So what messages are sent on the Vert.x bus and which message method is used is a routing question. Senders and receivers don't need to care.

### Routing Strategy

My first though was to hide routing as much as possible, but that creates a lot of limitations.

Components have indirect routing information passed to them by the creater of the component, and in general all routing is handled by the `APSComponent` base class for the APS components. Individual components should ignore routing completely. They just send and possibly receive messages not caring about anything else than the message.

Some components need to talk to each other locally, and some need to reach a backend. It is up to the code that creates the components to determine that by supplying a routing property of:

        {
            outgoing: "client/backend/all/all:backend/all:client/none",
            incoming: "client/all/all:client/none"
        }

Both outgoing and incomming can have more than one route. Routes are comma separated within the string. No spaces.

Do note the "none" at the end! Its more relevant for incoming than outgoing. It means what the word says. If a component does not react to any incoming messages, then there is no point in listening to incoming messages and the messaging code does not need to make an unceccesary call to a component that will do nothing with the provided message.

### Messages

When a message is sent, there is no from, there is only a to. My goal is that all code should only react to messages, and a reaction can possibly be a new message. But there should not be any specific reply message. A message might be reacted to by a client that updates something in a GUI, or it might be reacted to in the backend. Whatever sends the message sholdn't care. Where messages end upp is a routing question.

The `content` part can be missing or empty depending on `type`.

In the following specification any entry starting with '?' is optional.

#### General

        {
            "aps": { // To be moved to header instead ...
                "origin": "(address)",
                "app": "(app)",
                "type": "(message type)",
                "identity": {
                    userId: "(id)",
                    userName: "(name of user)",
                    auth: {
                        "type": "(authentication type)",
                        (authentication specific data)
                    }
                }
            },
            content: { // Will probably go away when "aps" is moved to header.
                ...message type specific data
            }
        }

#### --> Avail 

Client tells a backend that it exists and are ready for a GUI JSON document.

This is not a requirement, components can be created and a gui built with client code like any other React GUI. There are 2 components that works together and use this message: `APSPage` and `APSWebManager`. They will as default inform the backend that they are upp and running and the backend will send a JSON document with components to create. `APSWebMAnager` can however also be used with a property that tells it to not send the message, and only act as container, but create and supplying a common event bus to all children.

        {
            "aps": {
                "origin": "(address)"
                "app": "(app)",
                "type": "avail"
            }
        }

#### <-- Gui

Client receives a gui, most probably from backend, but can really be send from anywhere including client itself.

{  "aps": {  "origin": "(address)",  "app": "(app)",  "type": "gui"  },  "content": {  "id": "(comp id)",  "name": "(comp name)",  ?"group": "(name of group component belongs to if any.)",  "type": "(comp type)",  ?"class": "(class class ...)",  ?"disabled": true/false,  ?"enabled": "groupNotEmpty:(group)/namedComponentsNotEmpty:(names)"  "collectGroups": "(space separated list of groups to listen to and collect data from.)",  "(type specific)": "(...)",  ...,  "children": [  ...  ]()  } }

#### --> Create

        {
            "aps": {
                "origin": 'address'
                "app": 'app',
                "type": "create"
            }
            "content": {
        
            }
        }

## Eclipse Public License - v version 1.0

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1.  DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

1.  GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

1.  REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

1.  COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

1.  NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

1.  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

1.  GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

## Eclipse Public License -v 1.0 version 1.0

        Eclipse Public License -v 1.0
        
        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
        
        1. DEFINITIONS
        "Contribution" means:
        a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
        b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
        i) changes to the Program, and
        ii) additions to the Program;
        where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
        "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
        "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
        "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
        "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
        
        2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
        a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
        b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
        c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
        d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
        
        3. REQUIREMENTS
        A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
        a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
        b) its license agreement:
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
        When the Program is made available in source code form:
        a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
        b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
        Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
        Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
        
        4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
        Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
        For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
        
        5. NO WARRANTY
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
        
        6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        
        7. GENERAL
        If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
        If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
        All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
        This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
