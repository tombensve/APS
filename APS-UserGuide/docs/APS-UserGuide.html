    <H1>Application Platform Services (APS)</H1>
    <hr/>    <p>
      Please note that this project have been going on for quite some time and have changed architecture on the way. This mostly due to limited time working on it, and partly to being a playground.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The documentation is put together from multiple sources in different maven sub modules. A lot of this documentation is currently quite out of date. There are for example code examples done before lambdas! There are also maven modules that will be removed due to no longer being relevant for the current architecture, like JPA (which I originally did just to have something that worked on any OSGi container, rather than a container specific integrated solution). JPA is not compatible with current architecture which mostly works with JSON data.      
    </p>
    <hr/>    <p>
      OSGi Application Platform Services - A "smorgasbord" of OSGi services that focuses on ease of use and good enough functionality for many but wont fit all. It can be seen as osgi-ee-light-and-easy. The services are of platform type: configuration, database, JPA, etc, with companion web applications for administration.      
    </p>
    <p>
      All services that require some form of administration have an admin web application for that, that plugs into the general apsadminweb admin web application.      
    </p>
    <p>
      All administrations web applications are WABs and thus require that the OSGi server supports WABs.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Another point of APS is to be as OSGi server independent as possible, but as said above the admin web applications do need support for WABs.      
    </p>
    <p>
      APS is made using basic OSGi functionality and is not using blueprint and other fancy stuff! Each bundle has an activator that does setup, creates trackers, loggers, and manually dependency injects them into the service providers it publishes.      
    </p>
    <H2>Features</H2>
    <H3>Current</H3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
           A far better service tracker that does a better job at handling services coming and going. Supports service availability wait and timeout and can be wrapped as a proxy to the service. Instead of returning null it throws an exception if no service becomes available within the timeout, and is thus much easier to handle.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
           A configuration manager that extends deployed bundles by reading their configuration schema, their default configuration file, and their configuration id, and then loads and publishes an <code>APSConfig</code> instance with the bundles configuration. All active configurations are stored in a cluster (vertx/hazelcast). There will be a config web to edit configurations.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
           A filesystem service that provides a persistent filesystem outside of the OSGi server. The configuration service makes use of this to store configurations. Each client can get its own filesystem area, and canÂ´t access anything outside of its area.          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <H2>Pre Setup</H2>
    <p>
      The Filesystem service is part of the core and used by other services. It should preferably have its filesystem root outside of the server installation. The BundleContext.getDataFile(String) returns a path within the deploy cache and is only valid for as long a a bundle is deployed. The point with the FilesystemService is to have a more permanent filesystem outside of the application server installation. To provide the FilesystemService root the following system property have to be set and available in the JVM instance:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        aps.filesystem.root=&lt;root&gt;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      How to do this differs between servers. In Glassfish you can supply system properties with its admin gui.      
    </p>
    <p>
      If this system property is not set the default root will be BundleContext.getFile(). This can work for development setup, but not for more serious installations!      
    </p>
    <p>
      After this path has been setup and the server started, all other configuration can be done in http://.../apsadminweb/.      
    </p>
    <H1>The aps-apis bundle</H1>
    <p>
      This contains the general APIs for standard services that other bundles should implement. The APIs are actually one of the main points of APS. Its goal is to define trivially easy to use APIs for different things. Any needed complexity should be hidden within the API implementation and users should only have to deal with the simple API.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The project does provide a lot of implementations of the APIs. They are in 2 categories:      
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
           Intended to be deployed and used as is (ex: aps-vertx-provider).          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
           A "default" implementation that can be copied and modified / configured to own need. Of course implementations can also be written from scratch.          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For (1) there is of course nothing to stop it from being treated as (2) :-).      
    </p>
    <p>
      The aps-apis bundle also contains some base functionallity like a better service tracker and a generic bundle activator that does depenendy injections. These were previously (&lt;1.0.0) in a separate bundle called aps-tools-lib, but the relationships between that bundle and this finally became too circular so I merged aps-tools-lib into aps-apis.      
    </p>
    <H2>Tools</H2>
    <H3>APSServiceTracker</H3>
    <p>
      This does the same thing as the standard service tracker included with OSGi, but does it better with more options and flexibility. One of the differences between this tracker and the OSGi one is that this throws an <em>APSNoServiceAvailableException</em> if the service is not available. Personally I think this is easier to work with than having to check for a null result. I also think that trying to keep bundles and services up are better than pulling them down as soon as one depencency goes away for a short while, for example due to redeploy of newer version. This is why APSServiceTracker takes a timeout and waits for a service to come back before failing.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> that in previous version APSServiceTracker did all callbacks in a separate thread. This is no longer the case, and shouldn't have been from the beginning.      
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several variants of constructors, but here is an example of one of the most used ones within the APS services:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    APSServiceTracker&lt;Service&gt; tracker =
        new APSServiceTracker&lt;Service&gt;(context, Service.class, "20 seconds");
    tracker.start();
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that the third argument, which is a timeout can also be specified as an int in which case it is always in miliseconds. The string variant supports the a second word of "sec[onds]" and "min[utes]" which indicates the type of the first numeric value. "forever" means just that and requires just one word. Any other second words than those will be treated as milliseconds. The APSServiceTracker also has a set of constants for the timeout string value:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    public static final String SHORT_TIMEOUT = "3 seconds";
    public static final String MEDIUM_TIMEOUT = "30 seconds";
    public static final String LARGE_TIMEOUT = "2 minutes";
    public static final String VERY_LARGE_TIMEOUT = "5 minutes";
    public static final String HUGE_LARGE_TIMEOUT = "10 minutes";
    public static final String NO_TIMEOUT = "forever";
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      On bundle stop you should do:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    tracker.stop(context);
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      So that the tracker unregisters itself from receiving bundle/service events.      
    </p>
    <H4>Services and active service</H4>
    <p>
      The tracker tracks all instances of the service being tracked. It however have the notion of an active service. The active service is the service instance that will be returned by allocateService() (which is internally used by all other access methods also). On startup the active service will be the first service instance received. It will keep tracking other instances comming in, but as long as the active service does not go away it will be the one used. If the active service goes away then the the one that is at the beginning of the list of the other tracked instances will become active. If that list is empty there will be no active, which will trigger a wait for a service to become available again if allocateService() is called.      
    </p>
    <H4>Providing a logger</H4>
    <p>
      You can provide an APSLogger (see further down about APSLogger) to the tracker:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    tracker.setLogger(apsLogger);
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      When available the tracker will log to this.      
    </p>
    <H4>Tracker as a wrapped service</H4>
    <p>
      The tracker can be used as a wrapped service:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    Service service = tracker.getWrappedService();
    Service service = tracker.getWrappedService(boolean cacheCallsUntilServiceAvailable);
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      This gives you a proxied <em>service</em> instance that gets the real service, calls it, releases it and return the result. This handles transparently if a service has been restarted or one instance of the service has gone away and another came available. It will wait for the specified timeout for a service to become available and if that does not happen the <em>APSNoServiceAvailableException</em> will be thrown. This is of course a runtime exception which makes the service wrapping possible without loosing the possibility to handle the case where the service is not available.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>cacheCallsUntilServiceAvailable</em> parameter means just that. This makes the service non blocking. Otherwise any call to a method when service is not available will result in a wait() on the thread until a service is available. When this parameter is <code>true</code> however any calls to the service before a service is available will be cached and executed later when a service is available. Do note that the tracker wrapper provides a java.lang.reflect.Proxy implementation of the service interface. Under the surface it will do an <em>invoke</em> on the actual service object and this invoke can be saved for later in a lambda. There is however a big <strong>warning</strong> with this: This feature will obviously only work for methods that don't provide a return value! Since method calls may possible be done in the future they cannot return any value. And no, <em>Future&lt;?&gt;</em> cannot be used since it blocks, and we are trying to avoid blocking here!      
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't like this, don't use the <em>getWrappedService(true)</em>. The <em>.onActiveServiceAvailable(callback)</em> method can be used to receive the service instance when it is available.      
    </p>
    <H4>Using the tracker in a similar way to the OSGi standard tracker</H4>
    <p>
      To get a service instance you do:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    Service service = tracker.allocateService();
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that if the tracker has a timeout set then this call will wait for the service to become available if it is currently not available until an instance becomes available or the timeout time is reached. It will throw <em>APSNoServiceAvailableException</em> on failure in any case.      
    </p>
    <p>
      When done with the service do:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    tracker.releaseService();
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H4>Accessing a service by tracker callback</H4>
    <p>
      Note that the <em>onServiceAvailable</em>, <em>onServiceLeaving</em>, etc have historical reasons for the names, but do now accept multiple calls without overwriting previous callback. The reason for this is that <strong>APSActivator</strong> reuses a tracker instance for tracking the same service in different classes. This allow for each class to do an <em>onServiceAvailable(...)</em> and be called back when service is available. The easiest use of <strong>APSServiceTracker</strong> &amp; <strong>APSActivator</strong> is to inject tracker as a proxied instance of the service API, by declaring its type to be the service interface. There are however times when you need to know when a service is available and this provides that.      
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few variants to get a service instance by callback. When the callbacks are used the actual service instance will only be allocated during the callback and then released again.      
    </p>
    <H5>onServiceAvailable</H5>
    <p>
      This will result in a callback when any instance of the service becomes available. If there is more than one service instance published then there will be a callback for each.      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        tracker.onServiceAvailable(new OnServiceAvailable&lt;Service&gt;() {
            @Override
            public void onServiceAvailable(
                Service service,
                ServiceReference serviceReference
            ) throws Exception {
                // Do something.
            }
        });
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H5>onServiceLeaving</H5>
    <p>
      This will result in a callback when any instance of the service goes away. If there is more than one service instance published the there will be a callback for each instance leaving.      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        onServiceLeaving(new OnServiceLeaving&lt;Service&gt;() {
    
            @Override
            public void onServiceLeaving(
                ServiceReference service,
                Class serviceAPI
            ) throws Exception {
                // Handle the service leaving.
            }
        });
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that since the service is already gone by this time you don't get the service instance, only its reference and the class representing its API. In most cases both of these parameters are irellevant.      
    </p>
    <H5>onActiveServiceAvailable</H5>
    <p>
      This does the same thing as onServiceAvailable() but only for the active service. It uses the same <em>OnServiceAvailable</em> interface.      
    </p>
    <H5>onActiveServiceLeaving</H5>
    <p>
      This does the same thing as onServiceLeaving() but for the active service. It uses the same <em>OnServiceLeaving</em> interface.      
    </p>
    <H5>withService</H5>
    <p>
      Runs the specified callback providing it with a service to use. This will wait for a service to become available if a timeout has been provided for the tracker.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't use this in an activator start() method! onActiveServiceAvailable() and onActiveServiceLeaving() are safe in a start() method, this is not!      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        tracker.withService(new WithService&lt;Service&gt;() {
            @Override
            public void withService(
                Service service,
                Object... args
            ) throws Exception {
                // do something here.
            }
        }, arg1, arg2);
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      If you don't have any arguments this will also work:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        tracker.withService(new WithService&lt;Service&gt;() {
            @Override
            public void withService(
                Service service
            ) throws Exception {
                // do something here
            }
        });
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H5>withServiceIfAvailable</H5>
    <p>
      This does the same as withService(...) but without waiting for a service to become available. If the service is not available at the time of the call the callback will not be called. No exception is thrown by this!      
    </p>
    <H5>withAllAvailableServices</H5>
    <p>
      This is used exactly the same way as withService(...), but the callback will be done for each tracked service instance, not only the active.      
    </p>
    <H5>onTimeout (since 0.9.3)</H5>
    <p>
      This allows for a callback when the tracker times out waiting for a service. This callback will be called just before the <em>APSNoServiceAvailableException</em> is about to be thrown.      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    tracker.onTimeout(new OnTimeout() {
        @Override
        public void onTimeout() {
            // do something here
        }
    });
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H3>APSLogger</H3>
    <p>
      This provides logging functionality. The no args constructor will log to System.out by default. The OutputStream constructor will logg to the specified output stream by default.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The APSLogger can be used by just creating an instance and then start using the info(...), error(...), etc methods. But in that case it will only log to System.out or the provided OutputStream. If you however do this:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    APSLogger logger = new APSLogger();
    logger.start(context);
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      then the logger will try to get hold of the standard OSGi LogService and if that is available log to that. If the log service is not available it will fallback to the OutputStream.      
    </p>
    <p>
      If you call the <em>setServiceRefrence(serviceRef);</em> method on the logger then information about that service will be provied with each log.      
    </p>
    <H3>APSActivator</H3>
    <p>
      This is a BundleActivator implementation that uses annotations to register services and inject tracked services. Any bundle can use this activator by just importing the <em>se.natusoft.osgi.aps.activator</em> and <em>se.natusoft.osgi.aps.activator.annotation</em> packages.      
    </p>
    <p>
      This is actually a rather trivial class that just scans the bundle for classes and inspects all classes for annotations and act on them.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Please note</strong> that it does <em>class.getDeclaredFields()</em> and <em>class.getDeclaredMethods()</em>! This means that it will only see the bottom class of an inheritance hiearchy!      
    </p>
    <p>
      The following annotations are available:      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>@OSGiServiceProvider</strong> - This should be specified on a class that implements a service interface and should be registered as an OSGi service. <em>Please note</em> that the first declared implemented interface is used as service interface unless you specify serviceAPIs={Svc.class, ...}.      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    public @interface OSGiProperty {
        String name();
        String value();
    }

    <p>
      Do note that for the <em>serviceSetupProvider()</em> another solution is to use the <em>@BundleStart</em> (see below) and just create instances of your service and register them with the BundleContext. But if you use <em>@OSGiServiceProvider</em> to instantiate and register other "one instance" services, then using <em>serviceSetupProvider()</em> would look a bit more consistent.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>@APSExternalizabe</strong>, <strong>@APSRemoteService</strong> - These 2 annotations are synonyms and have no properties. They should be used on a service implementation class. When either of these are specified the "aps-externalizable=true" property will be set when the service is registered with the OSGi container. The APSExternalProtocolExtender will react on this property and make the service externally accessible.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>@OSGiService</strong> - This should be specified on a field having a type of a service interface to have a service of that type injected, and continuously tracked. Any call to the service will throw an APSNoServiceAvailableException (runtime) if no service has become available before the specified timeout. It is also possible to have APSServiceTracker as field type in which case the underlying configured tracker will be injected instead.      
    </p>
    <p>
      If <em>required=true</em> is specified and this field is in a class annotated with <em>@OSGiServiceProvider</em> then the class will not be registered as a service until the service dependency is actually available, and will also be unregistered if the tracker for the service does a timeout waiting for a service to become available. It will then be reregistered again when the dependent service becomes available again. Please note that unlike iPOJO the bundle is never stopped on dependent service unavailability, only the actual service is unregistered as an OSGi service. A bundle might have more than one service registered and when a dependency that is only required by one service goes away the other service is still available.

      TODO: Since APS is nowmore built on top of vertx, servlets no longer need to be supported. Vaadin (traditional) is not supported either due to requiring servlets. Vaadin web components that works with Angular and React is however supported.      
    </p>
    <H4>Usage as BundleActivator</H4>
    <p>
      The <em>APSActivator</em> class has 2 constructors. The default constructor without arguments are used for BundleActivator usage. In this case you just specify this class as your bundles activator, and then use the annotations described above. Thats it!      
    </p>
    <H4>Other Usage</H4>
    <p>
      Since the activator usage will manage and create instances of all annotated classes this will not always work in all situations. One example is web applications where the web container is responsible for creating servlets. If you specifiy APSActivator as an activator for a WAB bundle and then use the annotations in a servlet then APSActivator will have a managed instance of the servlet, but it will not be the same instance as the web contatiner will run.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore APSActivator has another constructor that takes a vararg of instances: <code>public APSActivator(Object...</code><code> instances)</code>. There is also a <code>public void addManagedInstance(Object instance)</code> method. These allow you to add an already existing instance to be managed by APSActivator. In addition to the provided existing instances it will still scan the bundle for classes to manage. It will however not double manage any class for which an existing instance of has already been provided. Any annotated class for which existing instances has not been provided will be instantiated by APSActivator.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Please note</strong> that if you create an instance of APSActivator in a servlet and provide the servlet instance to it and start it (you still need to do <em>start(BundleContext)</em> and <em>stop(BundleContext)</em> when used this way!), then you need to catch the close of the servlet and do <em>stop</em> then.      
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 2 support classes:      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
           [APSVaadinWebTools]: APSVaadinOSGiApplication - This is subclassed by your Vaading application.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
           [APSWebTools]: APSOSGiSupport - You create an instance of this in a servlet and let your servlet implement the <em>APSOSGiSupportCallbacks</em> interface which is then passed to the constructor of APSOSGiSupport.          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Both of these creates and manages an APSActivator internally and catches shutdown to take it down. They also provide other utilities like providing the BundleContext. See <em>APSWebTools</em> for more information.      
    </p>
    <H4>APSActivatorPlugin</H4>
    <p>
      Any implementing classes of this interface can be specified in META-INF/services/se.natusoft.osgi.aps.tools.APSActivatorPlugin file, one per line. These are loaded by java.util.ServiceLoader. The implementation can be provided by another bundle which should then export the relevant packages which can then be imported in the using bundle.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The APSActivatorPlugin API looks like this:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    public interface APSActivatorPlugin {
    
        interface ActivatorInteraction {
            void addManagedInstance(Object instance, Class forClass);
        }
    
        void analyseBundleClass(ActivatorInteraction activatorInteraction, Class bundleClass);
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Be warned</strong> that this is currently very untested! No APS code uses this yet.      
    </p>
    <H3>APSContextWrapper</H3>
    <p>
      This provides a static wrap(...) method:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    Service providedService = APSContextWrapper.wrap(serviceProvider, Service.class);
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      where <em>serviceProvider</em> is an instance of a class that implements <em>Service</em>. The resulting instance is a java.lang.reflect.Proxy implementation of <em>Service</em> that ensures that the <em>serviceProvider</em> ClassLoader is the context class loader during each call to all service methods that are annotated with @APSRunInBundlesContext annotation in <em>Service</em>. The wrapped instance can then be registered as the OSGi service provider.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally the threads context class loader is the original service callers context class loader. For a web application it would be the web containers context class loader. If a service needs its own bundles class loader during its execution then this wrapper can be used.      
    </p>
    <H3>ID generators</H3>
    <p>
      There is one interface:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    /**
     * This is a generic interface for representing IDs.
     */
    public interface ID extends Comparable&lt;ID&gt; {
    
        /**
         * Creates a new unique ID.
         *
         * @return A newly created ID.
         */
        public ID newID();
    
        /**
         * Tests for equality.
         *
         * @param obj The object to compare with.
         *
         * @return true if equal, false otherwise.
         */
        @Override
        public boolean equals(Object obj);
    
        /**
         * @return The hash code.
         */
        @Override
        public int hashCode();
    
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      that have 2 implementations:      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
           IntID - Produces int ids.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
           UUID - Produces java.util.UUID Ids.          
        </p>

    </p>
    <H2>APSConfigManager</H2>
    <p>
      This bunlde listens for other bundles and checks for the following MANIFEST.MF entries:      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
           <code>APS-Config-Id</code> A unique id for a configuration to manage.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
           <code>APS-Config-Schema</code> Points to a bundle relative JSON file containing an APS JSON schema, describing the configuration file. See aps-core-lib documentation for more information on the schema format.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
           <code>APS-Config-Default-Resource</code> Points to a bundle relative JSON file folowing the schema and containging default configuration values.          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For each bundle with an <code>APS-Config-Id</code> an instance of <code>APSConfig</code> is created loaded with current config from disk or cluster, or the default config file. If the config is new and has no previous configuration stored then the contents of the default configuration will be stored.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The created <code>APSConfig</code> is then published as an OSGi service and the following lookup property: <code>(apsConfigId=&lt;config id&gt;)</code>.      
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 2 ways to get configuration:      
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the configuration is published as an OSGi "service", a service tracker can be used to look it up. The APSServiceTracker has some special features that makes it easier and it can also be provided by APSActivator:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    @OSGiService( additionalSearchCriteria = "(apsConfigId=my-config-id)", nonBlocking = true )
    private APSServiceTracker&lt;APSConfig&gt; configTracker
    
    @Managed
    private BundleContext context
    
    private APSConfig config
    
    @Initializer
    void init() {
        this.configTracker.onActiveServiceAvailable { APSConfig config, ServiceReference configRef -&gt;
            this.config = this.context.getService(configRef);
            ...
        }
    
        this.configTracker.onActiveServiceLeaving { ServiceReference configRef, Class type -&gt;
            this.config = null
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that the first argument which actually is the APSConfig instance you want, cannot be saved. It only exists within the callback block. Thereby we must allocate a new usage by using the OSGi BundleContext to get it. This should of course be released again when your code no longer needs the configuration object.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The other and easier way to get configuration is to let APSActivator give it to you:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    private APSConfig config
    
    @ConfigListener(apsConfigId = "my-config-id")
    void config( APSConfig config ) {
        if (config != null) {
            this.config = config
            ...
        }
        else {
            this.config = null
        }
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      This is much easier, but actually does the same as the first example. The difference is that APSActivator does it for you. Note that the method will be called with a null value if the configuration is unpublished as an OSGi service! This will however only happen if the config is unpublished before aps-config-manager and the listening bundle shuts down. So basically your code must expect and handle a null, but cannot demand to allways get a null on shutdown.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that in both these cases you wait for the configuration to become available. The following would also be possible and can seem simpler:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    @OSGiService
    private APSConfig config
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      But in this case you will be blocking the thread if it is accessed before it is available. If this was done in code called from bundle activator then there would be a problem! The other two ways are completely non blocking and reactive in that you get it when it is available.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the code is doing, it can start doing it when the config is available. If it needs to do something that isn't quick, then it should work in another thread since the config listener call made by APSActivator needs to return rather quickly. Here is a suggestion: <code>APSExecutor.submit { ...</code><code> }</code>. This will then be submitted to a thread pool with as many threads as there are cores in the machine. APSActivator can also inject an <code>ExecutionService</code> that is backed by a thread pool for use by the bundle only. <code>APSExecutor</code> provides one thread pool for all bundles to share and are intended for shorter jobs.      
    </p>
    <H3>MapJSON</H3>
    <p>
      Configurations are JSON documents. <code>APSConfig</code>extends <code>Map&lt;String,</code><code> Object&gt;</code> and can thus be used as a Map representation of the JSON data, but it also has <code>lookup(String key)</code> method that takes a structured key (implemented by StructMap from aps-core-lib) to lookup a value. There is also a <code>provide( String structPath,</code><code> Object value )</code> method that is intended for configuration editors to use to update config values. An update of config value will update cluster and inform other nodes of the change. See documentation for StructMap in aps-core-lib for more information.      
    </p>
    <H1>APSFilesystemService</H1>
    <p>
      This provides a filesystem for writing and reading files. This filesystem resides outside of the OSGi server and is for longterm storage, which differs from BundleContext.getDataFile() which resides within bundle deployment. The APSFilesystemService also does not return a File object! It priovides a file area for each unique owner name that is accessed through an API that cannot navigate nor access any files outside of this area. The âownerâ name should be either an application name or a bundle name if it is only used by one bundle.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The APSConfigService uses the APSFilesystemService to store its configurations.      
    </p>
    <H2>Setup</H2>
    <p>
      The <em>aps.filesystem.root</em> system property must be set to point to a root where this service provides its file areas. This is either passed to the JVM at server startup or configured withing the server. Glassfish allows you to configure properties within its admin gui. Virgo does not. If this is not provided the service will use BundleContext.getDataFile(".") as the root, which will work for testing and playing around, but should not be used for more serious purposes since this is not a path with a long term availability.      
    </p>
    <H2>The service</H2>
    <p>
      The service allows you to create or get an APSFilesystem object. From that object you can create/read/delete directories (represented by APSDirectory) and files (represented by APSFile). You can get readers, writers, input streams and output streams from files. All paths are relative to the file area represented by the APSFilesystem object.

      This basically provides a class representing each JSON type: JSONObject, JSONString, JSONNumber, JSONBoolean, JSONArray, JSONNull, and a JSONValue class that is the common base class for all the other. Each class knows how to read and write the JSON type it represents. Then there is a JavaToJSON and a JSONToJava class with static methods for converting back and forth. This mapping is very primitive. There has to be one to one between the JSON and the Java objects.

    <p>
      <em>readJSON(...)</em> in the <strong>JSONValue</strong> base class now throws JSONEOFException (extends IOException) on EOF. The reason for this is that internally it reads characters which cannot return -1 or any non JSON data valid char to represent EOF. Yes, it would be possible to replace <em>char</em> with <em>Character</em>, but that will have a greater effect on existing code using this lib. If an JSONEOFException comes and is not handled it is still very much more clear what happened than a NullPointerException would be!

      Almost all exceptions within the APS services and libraries extend either <em>APSException</em> or <em>APSRuntimeException</em>. I decided to just extend RuntimeException here to avoid any other dependencies for this library since it can be useful outside of APS and can be used as any jar if not deployed in OSGi container.

    <H2>MapJsonDocValidator</H2>
    <p>
      This takes a schema (made up of a <code> Map&lt;String,</code><code> Object&gt; </code>, see below) and another <code> Map&lt;String,</code><code> Object&gt; </code> representing the JSON. So the catch here is that you need a JSON parser that allows you to get the content as a Map. The Vertx JSON parser does. This uses <code>Map</code> since it is generic, does not need to hardcode dependency on a specific parser, and maps are very easy to work with in Groovy.      
    </p>

    <p>
      This will throw a runtime exception on validation failure, specifically APSValidationException.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that there is also a special feature for defining a simple dynamic key=&gt;value map where the key is defined with a regexp and the value can be a regexp, string, number, or boolean. This is done be defining a map with only one entry. Example:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    private Map&lt;String, Object&gt; schema = [
        "nameAddress": [
            "?([a-z]|[0-9]|_|-)+": "?[0-9,.]+"
        ]
    ]
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      In this case <code>nameAdress</code> can contain any number of entries as long as each entry have a key containging a-z or 0-9 or _ or - and there must be at least one character, and the value only contains numbers and dots.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that when the key is a regexp (starts with '?') then there can be no more rule for this submap!      
    </p>
    <H3>Schema</H3>
    <H4>Keys</H4>
    <p>
      &lt;key&gt;_0 - The key is optional.      
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;key&gt;_1 - The key is required.      
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;key&gt;_? - A description of the key. MapJsonSchemaMeta extracts this information. It is intended for editors editing data of a file validated by a schema. This should provide help information about the value. Since APS uses the MapJsonDocSchemaValidator for configurations and is intended to have web guis for editing configuration this is intended to provide information about configuration fields.      
    </p>
    <p>
      ?regexp - special handling. See usage above.      
    </p>
    <H4>Values</H4>
    <H5>"?regexp"</H5>
    <p>
      The '?' indicates that the rest of the value is a regular expression. This regular expression will be applied to each value.      
    </p>
    <H5>"&lt;hash&gt;&lt;range&gt;"</H5>
    <p>
      This indicates that this is a number and defines the number range allowed. The following variants are available:      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>"#from-to"</strong> : This specifies a range of allowed values, from lowest to highest.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>"#&lt;=num"</strong> : This specifies that the numeric value must be less than or equal to the specified number.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>"#&gt;=num"</strong> : This specifies that the numeric value must be larger than or equal to the specified number.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>"#&lt;num"</strong> : This specifies that the numeric value must be less than the specified number.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>"#&gt;num"</strong> : This specifies that the numeric value must be larger than the specified number.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: Both floating point numbers and integers are allowed.      
    </p>
    <H5>"bla"</H5>
    <p>
      This requires values to be exactly "bla".      
    </p>
    <H4>Example</H4>
    <pre>
      <code>
    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; myJsonObject = JSON.readJsonAsMap( myJsonStream, jsonErrorHandler)
    ...
    
    Map&lt;String, object&gt; schema = JSON.readJsonAsMap(schemaStream, jsonErrorHandler)
    MapJsonDocValidator jsonValidator = new MapJsonDocValidator( validstructure: schema )
    
    jsonValidator.validate( myJsonObject )
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H2>MapJsonSchemaMeta</H2>
    <p>
      This class scans a MapJson schema as defined by MapJsonDocValidator and extracts a list of MapJsonEntryMeta instances for each value in a MapJson structure living up to the schema.      
    </p>
    <p>
      From these the following can be resolved:      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
           The name of a value.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
           The type of a value.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
           Is the value required ?          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
           The constraints of the value. If this starts with '?' then the rest is a regular expression.  If not the value is a constant, that is, the value has to be exactly as the constraint string.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
           A description of the value.          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is not used by the MapJsonDocValidator when validating! This is intended for GUI configuration editors to use to build a configuration GUI producing valid configurations.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Usage:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; schema
    ...
    new MapJsonSchemaMeta(schema).mapJsonEntryMetas.each { MapJsonEntryMeta mjem -&gt; ... }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H2>StructMap</H2>
    <p>
      This wraps a structured Map that looks like a JSON document, containing Map, List, and other 'Object's as values.      
    </p>
    <p>
      A key is a String containing branches separated by '.' characters for each sub structure.      
    </p>
    <p>
      It provides a method to collect all value referencing keys in the map structure with full key paths.      
    </p>
    <p>
      It provides a lookup method that takes a full value key path and returns a value.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that since this delegates to the wrapped Map the class is also a Map when compiled!      
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example (in Groovy) that shows how to lookup and how to use the keys:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    StructMap smap = new StructMap&lt;&gt;(

                                    [

      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that the values are API-wise of type Object! This is because it can be anything, like a String, Map, List, Number (if you stick to JSON formats) or any other type of value you put in there.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Also note the indexes in the keys in the example. It is not "webs[0]" but "webs.[0]"! The index is a reference name in itself. The keys returned by getAllKeys() have a number between the '[' and the ']' for List entries. This number is the number of entries in the list. The StructPath class (used by this class) can be used to provide array size of an array value.      
    </p>
    <H2>APSBus</H2>
    <p>
      Since there are many types of busses out there and that APS is based on Vert.x with its own bus (<em>EventBus</em>) APS provides a very simple, generic bus API called <strong>APSBus</strong>. It should be documented elsewhere in this document.      
    </p>
    <p>
      This bundle contains an implementation of APSBus. The <em>APSBus</em> implementation just tracks all published <code>APSBusRouter</code> implementations. Each <code>APSBusRouter</code> implementations must also provide a resource file in <em>aps/bus/routers</em> with the name of each bus router, one per line. APSBus will find all these and wait for them to become available as services before publishing itself as a service.      
    </p>
    <p>
      If an <code>APSBusRouter</code> implementation does not do this, then it is possible that APSBus will not see it. It is also possible that it will se it, but miss another implementation instead. This due to it actually not knowing the available implementations nor their names. It just count the entries in all found <em>routers</em> files, and waits for that amount of <code>APSBusRouter</code> services to be published. The names are just for show and are logged on startup.      
    </p>
    <H1>Web Manager</H1>
    <H2>Components</H2>
    <p>
      The components are mostly based on React-Bootstrap components. The APS components wrap other components to provide components that connect to a common bus. All relevant component events are are sent as messages on the bus. No code has to attach listeners to specific components. Any code that wants to react to a component being triggered does so by joining the bus and listen to messages. So the code reacting on messages really has no direct association with any component, they just react to messages.      
    </p>
    <p>
      All components has a listenTo and a sendTo property which points out and address to send or listen to. Most components only send messages.      
    </p>
    <p>
      This separation of component rendering code and event handler code makes it rather easy to render components after a JSON specification. That is what WebManager does. It listens for a JSON GUI spec on the bus, and when it sees such, it renders it. When a user interacts with the rendered GUI messges will be sent on the bus.      
    </p>
    <H2>APSEventBus</H2>
    <p>
      On the frontend there is a local <code>APSEventBus</code> that is used to send and receive messages. This is basically a wrapper. It does not do anything other than pass on to 'EventBusRouter's. There are 2 'EventBusRouter's: <code>APSLocalEventBusRouter</code>and <code>APSVertxEventBusRouter</code>. These are both added to <code>APSEventBus</code>.      
    </p>
    <H3>APSLocalEventBusRouter</H3>
    <p>
      This looks at the header of a message and if <em>routing</em> contains <em>client</em> then it passes the message to all registered local subscribers. This never goes out on the network, it only works internatlly in the client. This is used to communicate between different components locally.      
    </p>
    <H3>APSVertxEventBusRouter</H3>
    <p>
      This looks at the header of a message and if <em>routing</em> contains <em>backend</em> it does a send on the Vert.x client event bus bridge. A send does a round robin to to listeners of specified address. If <em>routing</em> contains <em>cluster</em> it does a publish on the Vert.x client event bus bridge. This goes to all listeners of the address in the whole cluster, including other clients.      
    </p>
    <H2>Messaging</H2>
    <p>
      A note: <em>Vert.x uses Hazelcast by default to handle the cluster.</em><em> Hazelcast by default manages a cluster on the same subnet only,</em><em> by multicast.</em><em> Hazelcast can of course be configured to create larger clusters.</em><em> But that is a Hazelcast thing,</em><em> not APS nor Vert.x.</em>      
    </p>
    <H3>Addresses</H3>
    <p>
      Each message must be addressed! An address is just a string. It can be anything. If you send to an address it will be received if there is something also listening to exactly the same address. See an address as a group name as is common in other messaging solutions.      
    </p>
    <p>
      As said above when a send is done on the Vert.x event bus it does a round robin between each listener of the "sent to" address. This to support load balancing.      
    </p>
    <H4>Address Strategy</H4>
    <p>
      Note: (app) refers to a specific application as a wildcard, and (UUID) refers to a generated UUID value.

      <strong>Note 1:</strong> Only clients have a unique address. They are the only ones that needs a unique address due to being the only unique thing.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note 2:</strong> Vert.x does a round robin on "send" to same address. Only backend messages are delivered with a send. All cluster messages are delived with a "publish" and will always go to every subscriber.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note 3:</strong> Both on client side and on backend, code is not interacting with the Vert.x bus, but local busses with message routers. So what messages are sent on the Vert.x bus and which message method is used is a routing question. Senders and receivers don't need to care.      
    </p>
    <H3>Routing Strategy</H3>
    <p>
      My first though was to hide routing as much as possible, but that creates a lot of limitations.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Components have indirect routing information passed to them by the creater of the component, and in general all routing is handled by the <code>APSComponent</code> base class for the APS components. Individual components should ignore routing completely. They just send and possibly receive messages not caring about anything else than the message.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Some components need to talk to each other locally, and some need to reach a backend. It is up to the code that creates the components to determine that by supplying a routing property of:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    {
        outgoing: "client/backend/all/all:backend/all:client/none",
        incoming: "client/all/all:client/none"
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Both outgoing and incomming can have more than one route. Routes are comma separated within the string. No spaces.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Do note the "none" at the end! Its more relevant for incoming than outgoing. It means what the word says. If a component does not react to any incoming messages, then there is no point in listening to incoming messages and the messaging code does not need to make an unceccesary call to a component that will do nothing with the provided message.      
    </p>
    <H3>Messages</H3>
    <p>
      When a message is sent, there is no from, there is only a to. My goal is that all code should only react to messages, and a reaction can possibly be a new message. But there should not be any specific reply message. A message might be reacted to by a client that updates something in a GUI, or it might be reacted to in the backend. Whatever sends the message sholdn't care. Where messages end upp is a routing question.

      The <code>content</code> part can be missing or empty depending on <code>type</code>.

      Client tells a backend that it exists and are ready for a GUI JSON document.      
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not a requirement, components can be created and a gui built with client code like any other React GUI. There are 2 components that works together and use this message: <code>APSPage</code> and <code>APSWebManager</code>. They will as default inform the backend that they are upp and running and the backend will send a JSON document with components to create. <code>APSWebMAnager</code> can however also be used with a property that tells it to not send the message, and only act as container, but create and supplying a common event bus to all children.      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    {
        "aps": {
            "origin": "(address)"

      "Contribution" means:      
    </p>
    <p>
      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.      
    </p>
    <p>
      "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.      
    </p>
    <p>
      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.      
    </p>
    <p>
      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.      
    </p>
    <p>
      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

    <p>
      A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:      
    </p>
    <p>
      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and      
    </p>
    <p>
      b) its license agreement:      
    </p>
    <p>
      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;      
    </p>
    <p>
      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;      
    </p>
    <p>
      iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and      
    </p>
    <p>
      iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.      
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Program is made available in source code form:      
    </p>
    <p>
      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and      
    </p>
    <p>
      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

           COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.      
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

    <pre>
      <code>
    Eclipse Public License -v 1.0
    
    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
    
    1. DEFINITIONS
    "Contribution" means:
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
    i) changes to the Program, and
    ii) additions to the Program;
    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
    "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
    "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
    "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
    
    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
    
    3. REQUIREMENTS
    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
    b) its license agreement:
    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
    When the Program is made available in source code form:
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
    Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
    
    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
    
    5. NO WARRANTY
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
    
    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    7. GENERAL
    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
