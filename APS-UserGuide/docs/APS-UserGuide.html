    <H1>Application Platform Services (APS)</H1>
    <p>
      OSGi Application Platform Services - A "smorgasbord" of OSGi services that focuses on ease of use and good enough functionality for many but wont fit all. It can be seen as osgi-ee-light-and-easy. The services are of platform type: configuration, database, JPA, etc, with companion web applications for administration.      
    </p>
    <p>
      All services that require some form of administration have an admin web application for that, that plugs into the general apsadminweb admin web application.      
    </p>
    <p>
      All administrations web applications are WABs and thus require that the OSGi server supports WABs.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Another point of APS is to be as OSGi server independent as possible, but as said above the admin web applications do need support for WABs.      
    </p>
    <p>
      APS is made using basic OSGi functionality and is not using blueprint and other fancy stuff! Each bundle has an activator that does setup, creates trackers, loggers, and manually dependency injects them into the service providers it publishes.      
    </p>
    <H2>Features</H2>
    <H3>Current</H3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A configuration service that works with annotated configuration models where each config value can be described/documented. The configuration model can be structured with sub models that there can be one or many of. Each top level configuration model registered with the configuration service will be available for publishing in the admin web. The configuration service also supports different configuration environments and allows for configuration values to be different for different configuration environments, but doesn´t require them to be.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A filesystem service that provides a persistent filesystem outside of the OSGi server. The configuration service makes use of this to store configurations. Each client can get its own filesystem area, and can´t access anything outside of its area.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A platform service that simply identifies the local installation and provides a description of it. It is basically a read only service that provides configured information about the installation.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A JPA service that is easier and more clearly defined than the osgi-ee JPA API, and allows for multiple JPA contexts. It works as an extender picking up persistence.xml whose defined persistence unit name can then be looked up using the service. A client can only lookup its own persistence units. It is based on OpenJPA.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A data source service. Only provides connection information, no pooling (OpenJPA provides its own pooling)!          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          External protocol extender that allows more or less any OSGi service to be called remotely using any deployed protocol service and transport. Currently provides JSONRPC 1.0 &amp; 2.0, JSONHTTP, and JSONREST protocols, and an http transport. Protocols have a defined service API whose implementations can just be dropped in to make them available. Transport providers can make use of any deployed protocol. The APSExternalProtocolService now provides support for REST services where there is a method for post, put, get,and delete, and the http transport makes use of this in conjunction with any protocol that indicates it can support REST like JSONREST.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A group service that can send data to each member over transport safe multicast.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A service discovery service using the group service.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A session service (not http!). This is used by apsadminweb to keep a session among several different administration web applications.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          An administration web service to which administration web applications can register themselves with an url and thus be available in the .../apsadminweb admin gui.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A user service. Provides basic user management including roles/groups. Is accompanied with a admin GUI (plugnis into apsadminweb) for administration of users. (org.osgi.service.useradmin.UserAdmin felt uncomplete. It did not provide what I wanted).          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A user authentication service. This does nothing more that authenticating a user and have a really simple API. APS provides an implementation that makes use of the user service, but it is easy to make another implementation that authenticates against an LDAP for example or something else. The Admin web applications uses the authentication service for authenticating admin users.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A far better service tracker that does a better job at handling services coming and going. Supports service availability wait and timeout and can be wrapped as a proxy to the service. Instead of returning null it throws an exception if no service becomes available within the timeout, and is thus much easier to handle.          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <H3>Planned</H3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          An implementation of the standard OSGi LogService since not all servers provide one.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A log veiwer web application supporting reqular expression filters on log information and a live log view. This is waiting on Vaadin 7.1 which will support server push. Another alternative is to go pure GWT and use Errai for this, but I rather continue with Vaadin having all admin webs looking and feeling the same.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Synchronizing configurations between installations so that all configuration for all configuration environments can be edited in one place and automatically be distributed to each installation. This would also make it possible to configure installations without deployed admin webs.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Anything else relevant I come up with and consider fun to do :-).          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <H3>Ideas</H3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A JCR (Java Content Repository) service and a content publishing GUI (following the general APS ambition - reasonable functionality and flexibility, ease of use. Will fit many, but not everyone).          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Support for being able to redeploy a web application and services live without loosing session nor user transactions. With OSGi it should be teoretically possible. For a limited number of redeployments at least. It is very easy to run into the "perm gen space" problem, but according to Frank Kieviet (<a href='http://frankkieviet.blogspot.se/2006/10/classloader-leaks-dreaded-permgen-space.html' title=''>Classloader leaks: The dreaded permgen space</a>) it is caused by bad code and can be avoided.

    </ul>
    <H2>Requirements</H2>
    <p>
      The administration web application(s) are currently WABs and thus require a server supporting WAB deployments. I have developed/tested this on Glassfish and Virgo. I am however considering seeing if it is possible to also support both Glassfish and JBoss JEE WAR to OSGi bridges. They are unfortunately very server specific since there are no such standard. Other than that all services are basic OSGi services and should theoretically run in any R4 compatible OSGi server.      
    </p>
    <H2>Pre Setup</H2>
    <p>
      The Filesystem service is part of the core and used by other services. It should preferably have its filesystem root outside of the server installation. The BundleContext.getDataFile(String) returns a path within the deploy cache and is only valid for as long a a bundle is deployed. The point with the FilesystemService is to have a more permanent filesystem outside of the application server installation. To provide the FilesystemService root the following system property have to be set and available in the JVM instance:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        aps.filesystem.root=&lt;root&gt;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      How to do this differs between servers. In Glassfish you can supply system properties with its admin gui.      
    </p>
    <p>
      If this system property is not set the default root will be BundleContext.getFile(). This can work for development setup, but not for more serious installations!      
    </p>
    <p>
      After this path has been setup and the server started, all other configuration can be done in http://.../apsadminweb/.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Please note</strong> that the /apsadminweb by default require no login! This so that <em>"Configurations tab</em>,<em> Configurations/persistence/datasources"</em> can be used to setup a datasource called "APSSimpleUserServiceDS" needed by APSSimpleUserService. If you use the provided APSAuthService implementation that uses APSSimpleUserService then you need to configure this datasource before APSSimpleUserService can be used. See the documentation for APSSimpleUserService further down in this document for more information on the datasource configuration. After that is setup go to <em>"Configurations tab</em>,<em> Configurations/aps/adminweb"</em> and enable the "requireauthentication" config. After having enabled this and saved, do a browser refresh and then provide userid and password when prompted.      
    </p>
    <H2>Javadoc</H2>
    <p>
      The complete javadoc for all services can be found at <a href='http://apidoc.natusoft.se/APS' title=''>http://apidoc.natusoft.se/APS</a>.      
    </p>
    <H1>APSConfigService</H1>
    <p>
      This is not the simple standard OSGi service configurations, but more an application config that can also be used for services. It supports structured configurations including lists of items and lists of subconfigurations. Code that uses the configuration provide one or more configuration classes with config items. These are registered with the config service, which makes them editable/publishable though and admin web app. After registration an instance of the config can be gotten containing published or defaul values. Alternatively the config class is specified with a fully qualified name in the <em>APS-Configs:</em> MANIFEST.MF entry. In this case the configuration service acts as an extender and automatically registers and provides an instance of the config for you, without having to call the config service.      
    </p>
    <H2>Configuration Environments</H2>
    <p>
      The APSConfigService supports different configuration environments. The idea is to define one config environment per installation. Configuration values can either be configuration environment specific or the same for all environments. See @ConfigItemDescription below for more information on specifying configuration environment specific values.      
    </p>
    <H2>Making a config class</H2>
    <p>
      Here is an example:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    @APSConfigDescription(
        version="1.0",
        configId="se.natusoft.aps.exmple.myconfig",
        group="examples",  
        description="An example configuration model"
    )
    public class MyConfig extends APSConfig {
        
    @APSConfigItemDescription(
        description="Example of simple value.",
    )
    public APSConfigValue simpleValue;
        
        @APSConfigItemDescription(
            description="Example of list value."
        )
        public APSConfigValueList listValue;
        
        @APSConfigItemDescription(
            description="One instance of MySubConfig model."
        )
        public MySubConfig mySubConfig;
        
        @APSConfigItemDescription(
            description="Multiple instances of MySubConfig model."
        )
        public APSConfigList&lt;MySubConfig&gt; listOfMySubConfigs;
        
        @APSConfigDescription(
            version="1.0",
            configId="se.natusoft.aps.example.myconfig.mysubconfig",
            description="Example of a subconfig model. Does not have to be inner class!"
        )
        public static class MySubConfig extends APSConfig {
            
         @APSConfigItemDescription(
                description="Description of values."
            )
            public APSConfigValueList listOfValues;
            
            @APSConfigItemDescription(
             description="Description of another value."
            )
            public APSConfigValue anotherValue;
        }
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H3>The config values </H3>
    <p>
      Now you might be wondering, why not an interface, and why <em>public</em> and why <em>APSConfigValue</em>, <em>APSConfigValueList</em>, and <em>APSConfigList</em>?      
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for not using an interface and provide a java.lang.reflect.Proxy implementation of it is that OSGi has separate class loaders for each bundle. This means a service cannot proxy an interface provided by another bundle. Well, there are ways to go around that, but I did not want to do that unless that was the only option available. In this case it wasn’t. Therefore I use the above listed APS*Value classes as value containers. They are public so that they can be accessed and set by the APSConfigService. When you get the main config class instance back from the service all values will have valid instances. Each APS*Value has an internal reference to its config value in the internal config store. So if the value is updated this will be immediately reflected since it is referencing the one and only instance of it in the config store.      
    </p>
    <p>
      All config values are strings! All config values are stored as strings. The <strong>APSConfigValue</strong> container however have <em>toBoolean()</em>, <em>toDate()</em>, <em>toDouble()</em>, <em>toFloat()</em>, <em>toInt()</em>, <em>toLong()</em>, <em>toByte()</em>, <em>toShort()</em>, and <em>toString()</em> methods on it.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>APSConfigList&lt;Type&gt;</strong> container is an <em>java.lang.Iterable</em> of &lt;Type&gt; type objects. The &lt;Type&gt; cannot however be anything. When used directly in a config model it must be &lt;Type extends APSConfig&gt;. That is, you can only specify other config models extending APSConfig. The only exception to that is <strong>APSConfigValueList</strong> which is defined as:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    public interface APSConfigValueList extends APSConfigList&lt;APSConfigValue&gt; {} 
      </code>
    </pre>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use <strong>APSConfigValue</strong> for plain values.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use <strong>APSConfigValueList</strong> for a list of plain values.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use <strong>* extends APSConfig</strong> for a subconfig model.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use <strong>APSConfigList&lt;* extends APSConfig&gt;</strong> for a list of subconfig models.          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <H3>The config annotations</H3>
    <p>
      The following 3 annotations are available for use on configuration models.      
    </p>
    <H4>@APSConfigDescription</H4>
    <pre>
      <code>
    @APSConfigDescription(
        version="1.0",
        configId="se.natusoft.aps.exmple.myconfig",
        group="docs.examples",
        description="An example configuration model"
    )
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      This is an annotation for a configuration model.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>version</strong> - The version of the config model. This is required.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>configId</strong> - The unique id of the configuration model. Use same approch as for packages. This is required.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>group</strong> - This specifies a group or rather a tree branch that the config belongs under. This is only used by the configuration admin web app to render a tree of configuration models. This is optional.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>description</strong> - This describes the configuration model.      
    </p>
    <H4>@APSConfigItemDescription</H4>
    <pre>
      <code>
    @APSConfigItemDescription(
        description="Example of simple value.",
        datePattern="yyMMdd",  
        environmentSpecific=true/false,  
        isBoolean=true/false,  
        validValues={"high", "medium", "low"}, 
    )
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      This is an annotation for a configuration item whithin a configuration model.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>description</strong> - This describes the configuration value. The configuration admin web app uses this to explain the configuration value to the person editing the configuration. This is required.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>datePattern</strong> - This is a date pattern that will be passed to SimpleDateFormat to convert the date in the string value to a java.util.Date object and is used by the <em>toDate()</em> method of APSConfigValue. This date format will also be displayed in the configuration admin web app to hint at the date format to the person editing the configuration. The configuration admin web app will also use a calendar field if this is available. The calendar field has a complete calendar popup that lets you choose a date. This is optional.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>environmentSpecific</strong> - This indicates that the config value can have different values depending on which config environment is active. This defaults to false in which case the value will apply to all config environments. This is optional.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>isBoolean</strong> - This indicates that the config value is of boolean type. This is used by the configuration admin web app to turn this into a checkbox rather than a text field. This defaults to false and is this optional.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>validValues</strong> - This is an array of strings ( {"...", ..., "..."} ) containing the only valid values for this config value. This is used by the configuration admin web app to provide a dropdown menu of the alternatives rather than a text field. This defaults to {} and is thus optional.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>defaultValue</strong> - This is an array of @APSDefaultValue annotations. Se the description of this annotation below. This allows not only for providing a default value, but for providing a default value per config environment (which is why there is an array of @APSDefaultValue annotations!). Thus you can deliver pre configured configuration for all configuration environments. If a config environment is not specified for a default value then it applies for all configuration environments. Some configuration values are better off without default values, like hosts and ports for other remote services. The application/server maintenance people responsible for an installation in general knows this information better than the developers.      
    </p>
    <H4>@APSDefaultValue</H4>
    <pre>
      <code>
    @APSDefaultValue {
        configEnv="production",
        value="15"
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      <strong>configEnv</strong> - This specifies the configuration environment this default value applies to. "default" means all/any configuration environment and is the default value if not specified.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>value</strong> - This is the default value of the configuration value for the configuration environment specified by configEnv.      
    </p>
    <H3>Auto managed configurations</H3>
    <p>
      It is possible to let the APSConfigService act as an extender and automatically register and setup config instances on bundle deploy by adding the <strong>APS-Configs:</strong> MANIFEST.MF header and a comma separated list of fully qualified names of config models. There are two variants of how to define the auto managed instance.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Warning</strong>: Auto managed configurations cannot ever be accessed during bundle activation in default activation thread! If the activation code starts a new thread then it is OK to access auto managed configuration in that thread, but only with variant 2! (the thread have to put itself to sleep until the configuration becomes managed. This is described below).      
    </p>
    <H4>Variant 1: A simple non instantiated static member of config model type</H4>
    <p>
      Example:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    @APSConfigDescription(
        version="1.0",
        configId="se.natusoft.aps.exmple.myconfig",
        group="examples",
        description="An example configuration model"
    )
    public class MyConfig extends APSConfig {
        
    --&gt;  public static MyConfig myConfig;  &lt;--
        
        @APSConfigItemDescription(
            description="Example of simple value.",
        )
        public APSConfigValue simpleValue;
        
        @APSConfigItemDescription(
            description="Example of list value."
        )
        public APSConfigValueList listValue;

      To access this variant of managed config do:      
    </p>
    <pre>

      <strong>A warning</strong>: This variant does not provide any support for determining if the configuration has become managaged yet. If you access it to early it will be null. Therefore you should only use this variant if you know it will become managed before it is referenced. The other variant allows you to check and wait for a config to become managed.

    <H4>Variant 2: A static instantiated ManagedConfig&amp;lt;ConfigModel&amp;gt; member. </H4>
    <p>
      Example:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    @APSConfigDescription(
        version="1.0",
        configId="se.natusoft.aps.exmple.myconfig",
        group="examples",
        description="An example configuration model"
        )
    public class MyConfig extends APSConfig {
        
    public static final ManagedConfig&lt;MyConfig&gt; managed = new ManagedConfig&lt;MyConfig&gt;();
        
        @APSConfigItemDescription(
            description="Example of simple value.",
        )
        public APSConfigValue simpleValue;
        
        @APSConfigItemDescription(
            description="Example of list value."
        )
        public APSConfigValueList listValue;
        ...
        
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      There is a possibility that code started in a bundle, especially threads might start running before the config has become managed. In such cases the following will solve that:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    if (!MyConfig.managed.isManaged()) {
        MyConfig.managed.waitUntilManaged();
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Do not ever do this during start() of a Bundle activator! That would cause a never ending dead-lock!      
    </p>
    <p>
      To access this variant of managed config do:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    MyConfig.managed.get().simpleValue.toString()/toInt()/toDouble()/...
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H2>API Usages</H2>
    <H3>The configuration service usage</H3>
    <p>
      The APSConfigService API looks like this:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    public interface APSConfigService {
        void registerConfiguration(Class&lt;? extends APSConfig&gt; configClass, boolean forService) throws APSConfigException;
        void unregisterConfiguration(Class&lt;? extends APSConfig&gt; configClass);
        &lt;Config extends APSConfig&gt; Config getConfiguration(Class&lt;Config&gt; configClass) throws APSConfigException;
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      On bundle start you register the configuration. On bundle stop you unregister it. Inbetween you access it. It is a good idea to call getConfiguration(...) after register on bundle start and the pass this instance to your services, etc.      
    </p>
    <p>
      If the <em>forServices</em> flag is <em>true</em> then this configuration will also be registered in the standard OSGi configuration service. Please be warned however that APSConfigService stores its configuration values in properties files, but with rather complex keys. For non structured, flat configurations it might make some sense to register it with the standard osgi service also, but in most cases there is no point in doing this. I'm not even sure why I have this option!      
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Please note</em> that if you are using managed configs (see above) then you never need to call this service API, not even lookup/track the APSConfigService!      
    </p>
    <H3>The configuration admin service usage</H3>
    <p>
      The APSconfigAdminService only needs to be used if you implement a configuration editor. APSConfigAdminWeb uses this API for example. See the javadoc for the API.      
    </p>
    <H2>The complete APS API</H2>
    <p>
      The complete APS javadoc can be found at <a href='http://apidoc.natusoft.se/APS/' title=''>http://apidoc.natusoft.se/APS/</a>.      
    </p>
    <H2>A word of advice</H2>
    <p>
      It is quite possible to make config structures of great complexity. <strong>DON'T!</strong> Even if it seems manageable from a code perspective it might not be that from a admin perspective. Keep it simple always apply!      
    </p>
    <H2>Administration</H2>
    <p>
      The configurations managed by the APS config service can be synchronized among a group of installations. To do this you need to enable synchronization in the <em>aps/config</em> node in the config admin web, and also specify a group name that you want to synchronize with. All installations having the same group name will synch configuration with each other. The synchronization uses the APSSync service so an implementation of this must be deployed for synchronization to work. There are currently 2 implementations provided, one using APSGroups (multicast only) and one using RabbitMQ (which of course also requires a RabbitMQ installation).

    <H1>APSFilesystemService</H1>
    <p>
      This provides a filesystem for writing and reading files. This filesystem resides outside of the OSGi server and is for longterm storage, which differs from BundleContext.getDataFile() which resides within bundle deployment. The APSFilesystemService also does not return a File object! It priovides a file area for each unique owner name that is accessed through an API that cannot navigate nor access any files outside of this area. The ”owner” name should be either an application name or a bundle name if it is only used by one bundle.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The APSConfigService uses the APSFilesystemService to store its configurations.      
    </p>
    <H2>Setup</H2>
    <p>
      The <em>aps.filesystem.root</em> system property must be set to point to a root where this service provides its file areas. This is either passed to the JVM at server startup or configured withing the server. Glassfish allows you to configure properties within its admin gui. Virgo does not. If this is not provided the service will use BundleContext.getDataFile(".") as the root, which will work for testing and playing around, but should not be used for more serious purposes since this is not a path with a long term availability.      
    </p>
    <H2>The service</H2>
    <p>
      The service allows you to create or get an APSFilesystem object. From that object you can create/read/delete directories (represented by APSDirectory) and files (represented by APSFile). You can get readers, writers, input streams and output streams from files. All paths are relative to the file area represented by the APSFilesystem object.      
    </p>

    <H1>APSJSONLib</H1>
    <p>
      This is a library (exports all its packages and provides no service) for reading and writing JSON. It can also write a JavaBean object as JSON and take a JSON value or inputstream containing JSON and produce a JavaBean.      
    </p>
    <p>
      This basically provides a class representing each JSON type: JSONObject, JSONString, JSONNumber, JSONBoolean, JSONArray, JSONNull, and a JSONValue class that is the common base class for all the other. Each class knows how to read and write the JSON type it represents. Then there is a JavaToJSON and a JSONToJava class with static methods for converting back and forth. This mapping is very primitive. There has to be one to one between the JSON and the Java objects.      
    </p>
    <H2>Changes  0.10.0 _readJSON(...)_ in the __JSONValue__ base class now throws JSONEOFException (extends IOException) on EOF. The reason for this is that internally it reads characters which cannot return -1 or any non JSON data valid char to represent EOF. Yes, it would be possible to replace _char_ with _Character_, but that will have a greater effect on existing code using this lib. If an JSONEOFException comes and is not handled it is still very much more clear what happened than a NullPointerException would be!  </H2>

    <H1>APSToolsLib</H1>
    <p>
      This is a library of utilities including a service tracker that beats the (beep) out of the default one including exception rather than null response, timeout specification, getting a proxied service implementation that automatically uses the tracker, allocating a service, calling it, and deallocating it again. This makes it trivially easy to handle a service being restarted or redeployed. It also includes a logger utility that will lookup the standard log service and log to that if found.      
    </p>
    <p>
      This bundle provides no services. It just makes all its packages public. Every bundle included in APS makes use of APSToolsLib so it must be deployed for things to work.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that this bundle has no dependencies! That is, it can be used as is without requireing any other APS bundle.      
    </p>
    <H2>APSServiceTracker</H2>
    <p>
      This does the same thing as the standard service tracker included with OSGi, but does it better with more options and flexibility. One of the differences between this tracker and the OSGi one is that this throws an <em>APSNoServiceAvailableException</em> if the service is not available. Personally I think this is easier to work with than having to check for a null result.      
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several variants of constructors, but here is an example of one of the most used ones within the APS services:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    APSServiceTracker&lt;Service&gt; tracker = 
        new APSServiceTracker&lt;Service&gt;(context, Service.class, "20 seconds");
    tracker.start();
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that the third argument, which is a timeout can also be specified as an int in which case it is always in miliseconds. The string variant supports the a second word of "sec[onds]" and "min[utes]" which indicates the type of the first numeric value. "forever" means just that and requires just one word. Any other second words than those will be treated as milliseconds. The APSServiceTracker also has a set of constants for the timeout string value:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    public static final String SHORT_TIMEOUT = "3 seconds";
    public static final String MEDIUM_TIMEOUT = "30 seconds";
    public static final String LARGE_TIMEOUT = "2 minutes";
    public static final String VERY_LARGE_TIMEOUT = "5 minutes";
    public static final String HUGE_LARGE_TIMEOUT = "10 minutes";
    public static final String NO_TIMEOUT = "forever";
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      On bundle stop you should do:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    tracker.stop(context);
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      So that the tracker unregisters itself from receiving bundle/service events.      
    </p>
    <H3>Services and active service</H3>
    <p>
      The tracker tracks all instances of the service being tracked. It however have the notion of an active service. The active service is the service instance that will be returned by allocateService() (which is internally used by all other access methods also). On startup it will be the first service instance received. It will keep tracking other instances comming in, but as long as the active service does not go away it will be the one used. If the active service goes away then the the one that is at the beginning of the list of the other tracked instances will become active. If that list is empty there will be no active, which will trigger a wait for a service to become available again if allocateService() is called.      
    </p>
    <H3>Providing a logger</H3>
    <p>
      You can provide an APSLogger (see further down about APSLogger) to the tracker:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    tracker.setLogger(apsLogger);
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      When available the tracker will log to this.      
    </p>
    <H3>Tracker as a wrapped service</H3>
    <p>
      The tracker can be used as a wrapped service:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    Service service = tracker.getWrappedService();
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      This gives you a proxied <em>service</em> instance that gets the real service, calls it, releases it and return the result. This handles transparently if a service has been restarted or one instance of the service has gone away and another came available. It will wait for the specified timeout for a service to become available and if that does not happen the <em>APSNoServiceAvailableException</em> will be thrown. This is of course a runtime exception which makes the service wrapping possible without loosing the possibility to handle the case where the service is not available.      
    </p>
    <H3>Using the tracker in a similar way to the OSGi standard tracker</H3>
    <p>
      To get a service instance you do:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    Service service = tracker.allocateService();
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that if the tracker has a timeout set then this call will wait for the service to become available if it is currently not available until an instance becomes available or the timeout time is reached. It will throw <em>APSNoServiceAvailableException</em> on failure in any case.      
    </p>
    <p>
      When done with the service do:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    tracker.releaseService();
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H3>Accessing a service by tracker callback</H3>
    <p>
      There are a few variants to get a service instance by callback. When the callbacks are used the actual service instance will only be allocated during the callback and then released again.      
    </p>
    <H4>onServiceAvailable</H4>
    <p>
      This will result in a callback when any instance of the service becomes available. If there is more than one service instance published then there will be a callback for each.      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        tracker.onServiceAvailable(new OnServiceAvailable&lt;Service&gt;() {
            @Override
            public void onServiceAvailable(Service service, ServiceReference serviceReference) throws Exception {
                // Do something.
            }
        });
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H4>onServiceLeaving</H4>
    <p>
      This will result in a callback when any instance of the service goes away. If there is more than one service instance published the there will be a callback for each instance leaving.      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        onServiceLeaving(new OnServiceLeaving&lt;Service&gt;() {
    
            @Override
            public void onServiceLeaving(ServiceReference service, Class serviceAPI) throws Exception {
                // Handle the service leaving.
            }
        });
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that since the service is already gone by this time you don't get the service instance, only its reference and the class representing its API. In most cases both of these parameters are irellevant.      
    </p>
    <H4>onActiveServiceAvailable</H4>
    <p>
      This does the same thing as onServiceAvailable() but only for the active service. It uses the same <em>OnServiceAvailable</em> interface.      
    </p>
    <H4>onActiveServiceLeaving</H4>
    <p>
      This does the same thing as onServiceLeaving() but for the active service. It uses the same <em>OnServiceLeaving</em> interface.      
    </p>
    <H4>withService</H4>
    <p>
      Runs the specified callback providing it with a service to use. This will wait for a service to become available if a timeout has been provided for the tracker.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't use this in an activator start() method! onActiveServiceAvailable() and onActiveServiceLeaving() are safe in a start() method, this is not!      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        tracker.withService(new WithService&lt;Service&gt;() {
            @Override
            public void withService(Service service, Object... args) throws Exception {
                // do something here.
            }
        }, arg1, arg2);
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      If you don't have any arguments this will also work:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        tracker.withService(new WithService&lt;Service&gt;() {
            @Override
            public void withService(Service service) throws Exception {
                // do something here
            }
        });
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H4>withServiceIfAvailable</H4>
    <p>
      This does the same as withService(...) but without waiting for a service to become available. If the service is not available at the time of the call the callback will not be called. No exception is thrown by this!      
    </p>
    <H4>withAllAvailableServices</H4>
    <p>
      This is used exactly the same way as withService(...), but the callback will be done for each tracked service instance, not only the active.      
    </p>
    <H4>onTimeout (since 0.9.3)</H4>
    <p>
      This allows for a callback when the tracker times out waiting for a service. This callback will be called just before the <em>APSNoServiceAvailableException</em> is about to be thrown.      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    tracker.onTimeout(new OnTimeout() {
        @Override
        public void onTimeout() {
            // do something here
        }
    }); 
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H2>APSLogger</H2>
    <p>
      This provides logging functionality. The no args constructor will log to System.out by default. The OutputStream constructor will logg to the specified output stream by default.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The APSLogger can be used by just creating an instance and then start using the info(...), error(...), etc methods. But in that case it will only log to System.out or the provided OutputStream. If you however do this:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    APSLogger logger = new APSLogger();
    logger.start(context);
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      then the logger will try to get hold of the standard OSGi LogService and if that is available log to that. If the log service is not available it will fallback to the OutputStream.      
    </p>
    <p>
      If you call the <code>setServiceRefrence(serviceRef);</code> method on the logger then information about that service will be provied with each log.      
    </p>
    <H2>APSActivator</H2>
    <p>
      This is a BundleActivator implementation that uses annotations to register services and inject tracked services. Any bundle can use this activator by just importing the <em>se.natusoft.osgi.aps.tools</em> package.      
    </p>
    <p>
      This is actually a rather trivial class that just scans the bundle for classes and inspects all classes for annotations and act on them. Most methods are protected making it easy to subclass this class and expand on its functionality.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Please note</strong> that it does <em>class.getDeclaredFields()</em> and <em>class.getDeclaredMethods()</em>! This means that it will only see the bottom class of an inheritance hiearchy!      
    </p>
    <p>
      The following annotations are available:      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>@OSGiServiceProvider</strong> - This should be specified on a class that implements a service interface and should be registered as an OSGi service. <em>Please note</em> that the first declared implemented interface is used as service interface unless you specify serviceAPIs={Svc.class, ...}.      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    public @interface OSGiProperty {
        String name();

    </pre>
    <p>
      <strong>@OSGiService</strong> - This should be specified on a field having a type of a service interface to have a service of that type injected, and continuously tracked. Any call to the service will throw an APSNoServiceAvailableException (runtime) if no service has become available before the specified timeout. It is also possible to have APSServiceTracker as field type in which case the underlying configured tracker will be injected instead.      
    </p>
    <p>
      If <em>required=true</em> is specified and this field is in a class annotated with <em>@OSGiServiceProvider</em> then the class will not be registered as a service until the service dependency is actually available, and will also be unregistered if the tracker for the service does a timeout waiting for a service to become available. It will then be reregistered again when the dependent service becomes available again. Please note that unlike iPOJO the bundle is never stopped on dependent service unavailability, only the actual service is unregistered as an OSGi service. A bundle might have more than one service registered and when a dependency that is only required by one service goes away the other service is still available.      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>

        boolean required() default false;
    
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      <strong>@Managed</strong> - This will have an instance managed and injected. There will be a unique instance for each name specified with the default name of "default" being used if none is specified. There are 2 field types handled specially: BundleContext and APSLogger. A BundleContext field will get the bundles context injected. For an APSLogger instance the 'loggingFor' annotation property can be specified. Please note that any other type must have a default constructor to be instantiated and injected!      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    public @interface Managed {
        /**
         * The name of the instance to inject. If the same is used in multiple classes the same instance will

        String loggingFor() default "";
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      <strong>@BundleStart</strong> - This should be used on a method and will be called on bundle start. The method should take no arguments. If you need a BundleContext just inject it with @APSInejct. The use of this annotation is only needed for things not supported by this activator. Please note that a method annotated with this annotation can be static (in which case the class it belongs to will not be instantiaded -- due to this!). You can provide this annotation on as many methods in as many classes as you want. They will all be called (in the order classes are discovered in the bundle).      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    public @interface BundleStart {
    
        /**
         * If true the start method will run in a new thread. Any failures in this case will not fail
         * the bundle startup, but will be logged.
         */
        boolean thread() default false;
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      <strong>@BundleStop</strong> - This should be used on a method and will be called on bundle stop. The method should take no arguments. This should probably be used if @APSBundleStart is used. Please note that a method annotated with this annotation can be static!      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    public @interface BundleStop {}
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H3>Usage as BundleActivator</H3>
    <p>
      The <em>APSActivator</em> class has 2 constructors. The default constructor without arguments are used for BundleActivator usage. In this case you just specify this class as your bundles activator, and then use the annotations described above. Thats it!      
    </p>
    <H3>Other Usage</H3>
    <p>
      Since the activator usage will manage and create instances of all annotated classes this will not always work in all situations. One example is web applications where the web container is responsible for creating servlets. If you specifiy APSActivator as an activator for a WAB bundle and then use the annotations in a servlet then APSActivator will have a managed instance of the servlet, but it will not be the same instance as the web contatiner will run.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore APSActivator has another constructor that takes a vararg of instances: <code>public APSActivator(Object..</code>.<code> instances)</code>. There is also a <code>public void addManagedInstance(Object instance)</code> method. These allow you to add an already existing instance to be managed by APSActivator. In addition to the provided existing instances it will still scan the bundle for classes to manage. It will however not double manage any class for which an existing instance of has already been provided. Any annotated class for which existing instances has not been provided will be instantiated by APSActivator.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Please note</strong> that if you create an instance of APSActivator in a servlet and provide the servlet instance to it and start it (you still need to do <em>start(BundleContext)</em> and <em>stop(BundleContext)</em> when used this way!), then you need to catch the close of the servlet and do <em>stop</em> then.      
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 2 support classes in <em>APSWebTools</em>:      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          APSVaadinOSGiApplication - This is subclassed by your Vaading application.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          APSOSGiSupport - You create an instance of this in a servlet and let your servlet implement the <em>APSOSGiSupportCallbacks</em> interface which is then passed to the constructor of APSOSGiSupport.          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Both of these creates and manages an APSActivator internally and catches shutdown to take it down. They also provide other utilities like providing the BundleContext. See <em>APSWebTools</em> for more information.      
    </p>
    <H2>APSContextWrapper</H2>
    <p>
      This provides a static wrap(...) method:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    Service providedService = APSContextWrapper.wrap(serviceProvider, Service.class);
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      where <em>serviceProvider</em> is an instance of a class that implements <em>Service</em>. The resulting instance is a java.lang.reflect.Proxy implementation of <em>Service</em> that ensures that the <em>serviceProvider</em> ClassLoader is the context class loader during each call to all service methods that are annotated with @APSRunInBundlesContext annotation in <em>Service</em>. The wrapped instance can then be registered as the OSGi service provider.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally the threads context class loader is the original service callers context class loader. For a web application it would be the web containers context class loader. If a service needs its own bundles class loader during its execution then this wrapper can be used.      
    </p>
    <H2>ID generators</H2>
    <p>
      There is one interface:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    /**
     * This is a generic interface for representing IDs. 
     */
    public interface ID extends Comparable&lt;ID&gt; {
    
        /**
         * Creates a new unique ID.
         *
         * @return A newly created ID.
         */
        public ID newID();
    
        /**
         * Tests for equality.
         *
         * @param obj The object to compare with.
         *
         * @return true if equal, false otherwise.
         */
        @Override
        public boolean equals(Object obj);
    
        /**
         * @return The hash code.
         */
        @Override
        public int hashCode();
    
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      that have 2 implementations:      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          IntID - Produces int ids.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          UUID - Produces java.util.UUID Ids.          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <H1>APSWebTools</H1>
    <p>
      This is not an OSGi bundle! This is a plain jar containing utilities for web applications. Specifically APS administration web applications. This jar has to be included in each web application that wants to use it.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other things it provides support for being part of the APS administration web login (APSAdminWebLoginHandler). Since the APS administration web is built using Vaadin it has Vaadin support classes. APSVaadinOSGiApplication is a base class used by all APS administration webs.

    <H1>APSAuthService</H1>
    <p>
      This is a very simple little service that only does authentication of users. This service is currently used by the APS administration web (/apsadminweb) and APSExtProtocolHTTPTransportProvider for remote calls to services over http.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea behind this service is that it should be easy to provide an implementation of this that uses whatever authentication scheme you want/need. If you have an LDAP server you want to authenticate against for example, provide an implementation that looks up and authenticates the user against the LDAP server.      
    </p>
    <p>
      See this a little bit like an authentication plugin.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The APS web applications that use this only uses password authentication.      
    </p>
    <H2>APSSimpleUserServiceAuthServiceProvider</H2>
    <p>
      This provides an APSAuthService that uses the APSSimpleUserService to authenticate users. It only supports password authentication. If you don't have your own implementation of APSAuthService then you can deploy this one along with APSSimpleUserService, and probably APSUserAdminWeb.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Please note</strong> however that the standard implementation of APSSimpleUserService can register several instances with an "instance=name" property where name is unique for each instance, and each instance can reference a different data source. This is configured under <em>persistence/dsrefs</em> in the configuration. If no instances are configured an instance of "aps-admin-web" will be created by default. If instances are configured the default will not be created. And now the the point: APSSimpleuserServiceAuthServiceProvider will as of now track the "aps-admin-web" instance of APSSimpleUserService! If no such instance is configured it will fail after a timeout of not finding a service!

      This is intended to be used as a wrapper to other means of authentication. Things in APS that needs authentication uses this service.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations can lookup the user in an LDAP for example, or use some other user service.      
    </p>

    <H1>APSSimpleUserService</H1>
    <p>
      This is an simple, easy to use service for handling logged in users. It provides two services: APSSimpleUserService and APSSimpleUserServiceAdmin. The latter handles all creation, editing, and deletion of roles and users. This service in itself does not require any authentication to use! Thereby you have to trust all code in the server! The APSUserAdminWeb WAB bundle however does require a user with role <em>apsadmin</em> to be logged in or it will simply repsond with a 401 (UNAUTHORIZED).      
    </p>
    <p>
      So why this and not org.osgi.service.useradmin ? Well, maybe I'm just stupid, but <em>useradmin</em> does not make sense to me. It seems to be missing things, specially for creating. You can create a role, but you cannot create a user. There is no obvious authentication of users. Maybee that should be done via the credentials Dictionary, but what are the expected keys in there ? APSSimpleUserService is intended to make user and role handling simple and clear.      
    </p>
    <H2>Basic example</H2>
    <p>
      To login a user do something like this:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    APSSimpleUserService userService ...
    ...
    User user = userService.getUser(userId);
    if (user == null) {
        throw new AuthException("Bad login!");
    }
    if (!userService.authenticateUser(user, password, APSSimpleUserService.AUTH_METHOD_PASSWORD)) {
        throw new AuthException("Bad login!");
    }
    ...
    if (user.isAuthenticated() &amp;&amp; user.hasRole("apsadmin")) {
        ...
    }
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H2>Setup</H2>

The above empty lines are required due to a bug in iText used to render the PDF. It will move the picture to the next page completely out of context since text after the picture will then come before it. 
    -->
    <p>
      After the tables have been created you need to configure a datasource for it in /apsadminweb configuration tab:      
    </p>
    <p>
            <img src='http://download.natusoft.se/Images/APS/APS-Auth/APSSimpleUserServiceProvider/docs/images/DataSourceConfig.png' title='' alt='Picture of datasource config gui.'/>      
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that the above picture is just an example. The data source name <em>APSSimpleUserServiceDS</em> in this example should be configured in the <em>persistence/dsRefs</em> config where you provide a name and a datasource reference. The service will be looking up the entry with that name, and use the specified datasource! For example:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    name: aps-admin-web
    dsRef: APSSimpleUserServiceDS
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      This example happens to be the default if no instances have been configured and is required if you want to use authentication for the APS admin web. You should probably define your own instance if you are going to use this service. The <em>dsRef</em> part is exactly the same name as defined in the data source configuration (<em>persistence/datasources</em>).      
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the datasource entry in the picture above depends on your database and where it is running. Also note that the "(default)" after the field names in the above picture are the name of the currently selected configuration environment. This configuration is configuration environment specific. You can point out different database servers for different environments for example.      
    </p>
    <p>
      When the datasource is configured and saved then you can go to <em>"Configuration tab</em>,<em> Configurations/aps/adminweb"</em> and enable the "requireauthentication" config. <strong>If you do this before setting up the datasource and you have choosen to use the provided implementation of APSAuthService that uses APSSimpleUserService to login then you will be completely locked out!</strong>      
    </p>
    <H2>Troubleshooting</H2>
    <p>
      If you have managed to lock yourself out of /apsadminweb as described above then I suggest editing the <em>APSFilesystemService root</em>/filesystems/se.natusoft.osgi.aps.core.config.service.APSConfigServiceProvider/apsconfig-se.natusoft.aps.adminweb-1.0.properties file and changeing the following line:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    se.natusoft.aps.adminweb_1.0_requireauthentication=true
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>

    <H2>JDBC Drivers</H2>
    <p>
      There is a catch with OSGi and its classpath isolation. The <em>APSSimpleUserService</em> makes use of the <em>APSJPAService</em> whose implementation <em>APSOpenJPAProvider</em> cheats OSGi a bit by using <em>MultiBundleClassLoader</em> (is available in aps-tools-library bundle) and merges the service classpath with the client classpath which is a requirement for the JPA framework to work (it needs access to both framework code in the service classpath and client entities in the client classpath). This also has the side effect that the client can provide a JDBC driver in its bundle. The <em>APSSimpleUserService</em> do provide a JDBC driver for <em>Derby 10.9.1.0</em>.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Another catch with this is that users of <em>APSSimpleUserService</em> are not part of this collective classpath and can thereby not make drivers available in their bundles, or at least not right off, there is however a workaround to this. There is a natsty way that you can pass on the client bundle class loader right through the <em>APSSimpleUserService</em> to <em>APSJPAService</em> by creating an instance of <em>MultiBundleClassLoader</em> and set it as context classloader:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    MultiBundleClassLoader mbClassLoader = new MultiBundleClassLoader(bundleContext.getBundle());
    Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(mbClassLoader);
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Do this before the first call to <em>APSSimpleUserService</em>. The <em>APSJPAService</em> will check if the current context class loader is a MultiBundleClassLoader and if so extract the bundles from it and add to its own MultiBundleClassLoader. This way you have extended the classpath that the JPA framework will se to 3 bundles: aps-openjpa-provider, aps-simple-user-service-provider, and your client bundle, which can then contain a JDBC driver.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The catches are unfortunately not over yet! You also need to configure your own instance of <em>APSSimpleUserService</em> with its own data source in the configuration, and your client needs to add the name of this configuration to the tracker for the <em>APSSimpleUserService</em> :      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    APSServiceTracker&lt;APSSimpleUserService&gt; userServiceTracker = 
        new APSServiceTracker&lt;&gt;(bundleContext, APSSimpleUserService.class, "(instance=instName)", "30 seconds");
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      or      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    @OSGiService(additionalSearchCriteria="(instance=instName)", timeout="30 seconds")
    APSSimpleUserService userService;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      where <em>instName</em> is whatever name you gave the instance in the configuration. Then try to have only one bundle call this service since each different bundle calling the service will extend the service classpath with that bundle!      
    </p>

    <H1>APSDataSource</H1>
    <p>
      This is a service that provides named data source definitions. It does <strong>not</strong> provide pooled <em>javax.sql.DataSource</em> instances! It only provides definitions with connection url, driver name, user and password. This service can be used by other services that provide DataSource pooling for example. The APSSimpleUserServiceProvider makes use of this service by looking up ”APSSimpleUserServiceDS” passing the information on to the APSJPAService in its properties. Not everything can make use of an <em>javax.sql.DataSource</em>, but everything can make use of the information provided by this service.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual data source definitions are configured in the <em>/apsadminweb</em> under configuration group ”persistence”.

    <H1>APSJPAService</H1>
    <p>
      This provides JPA to services and applications. It has a slightly more OSGi friendly API than the org.osgi.service.jpa.EntityManagerFactoryBuilder. The APSOpenJPAProvider however returns an APSJPAService instance that also implements EntityManagerFactoryBuilder. For some reason I haven’t figured out yet, it cannot be registered as a service with the EntityManagerFactoryBuilder interface! The bundle fails to deploy if that is done.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The provided service is using OpenJPA. The service works partly as an extender inspecting deployed bundles for a META-INF/persistence.xml file. When found this is read and some setup is done already there. The persistenceUnitName from the persistence.xml file is used to connect the client later with its configuration. When a JPA using bundle is shut down its JPA setup is automatically cleaned.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of usage:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        private APSJPAEntityManagerProvider emp = null;
        ...
        private APSJPAEntityManagerProvider getEMP() {
            if (this.emp == null || !this.emp.isValid()) {
                DataSourceDef dsDef = this.dataSourceDefService.lookupByName(”MyDS");
                if (dsDef == null) {
                    throw new SomeException("Could not find an ’MyDs’ in 'persistence/datasources' configuration!");
                }
                Map&lt;String, String&gt; props = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();
                props.put("javax.persistence.jdbc.user", dsDef.getConnectionUserName());
                props.put("javax.persistence.jdbc.password", dsDef.getConnectionPassword());
                props.put("javax.persistence.jdbc.url", dsDef.getConnectionURL());
                props.put("javax.persistence.jdbc.driver", dsDef.getConnectionDriveName());
                this.emp = this.jpaService.initialize(this.bundleContext, ”myPersistenceUnitName”, props);
            }
            return this.emp;
        }
        ...
        EntityManager em = getEMP().createEntityManager();
        em.getTransaction().begin();
    
        try {
            RoleEntity role = new RoleEntity(id);
            role.setDescription(description);
            em.persist(role);
            em.getTransaction().commit();
        }
        catch (RuntimeException re) {
            em.getTransaction().rollback();
            throw re;
        }
        finally {
            em.close();
        }
            
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      This code example handles the APSJPAService having been restared or redeployed. When <code>emp.isValid()</code> returns false then all you need to do is to call <code>jpaService.initialize(...)</code> again. The rest is just POJPA (Plain Old JPA :-)).      
    </p>
    <H2>APIs</H2>
    <p>
      public <em>interface</em> <strong>APSJPAService </strong>   [se.natusoft.osgi.aps.api.data.jpa.service] {      
    </p>
    <p>
      This service allows an JPA <em>EntityManager</em> to be gotten for a persistent unit name.      
    </p>
    <p>
      So why is this done this way ? Why is not an <em>EntityManagerFactory</em> returned?      
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer to that is that the <em>EntityManagerFactory</em> is internal to the service who is responsible for creating it and for closing it at sometime (stopping of bundle). The client only needs an <em>EntityManager</em> for which the client is responsible after its creation.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The creation of the <em>EntityManagerFactory</em> is delayed until the call to <em>initialize(...)</em>. Creating the EMF along with the persistence provider at persistence bundle discovery would limit database connection properties to the persistence.xml file which is less than optimal to put it mildly. This way a client can make use of the <em>APSDataSourceDefService</em> to get the JDBC properties which it can pass along to this service.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The default provider implementation of this service uses OpenJPA which provides its own connection pooling.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>APSJPAEntityManagerProvider initialize(BundleContext bundleContext, String persistenceUnitName, Map&lt;String, String&gt; props) throws APSResourceNotFoundException</strong>

      Initializes and returns a provider from the specified properties.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Returns</em>      
    </p>

        <em>props</em> - Custom properties to configure database, etc.

      Once you get this it is valid until the <em>APSJPAService</em> is stopped (which will happen if the service is redeployed!).      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>public boolean isValid()</strong>      
    </p>
    <p>
      Returns true if this instance is valid. If not call APSJPAService.initialize(...) again to get a new instance. It will be invalid if the APSJPAService provider have been restarted.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>EntityManager createEntityManager()</strong>      
    </p>
    <p>
      Creates a new <em>EntityManager</em>. You are responsible for closing it!      
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that the <em>EntityManager</em> caches all referenced entities. If you keep and reuse it for a longer time it can use more memory. For example at <a href='http://docs.jboss.org/ejb3/app-server/tutorial/extended_pc/extended.html' title=''>http://docs.jboss.org/ejb3/app-server/tutorial/extended_pc/extended.html</a> it says that "Usually, an <em>EntityManager</em> in JBoss EJB 3.0 lives and dies within a JTA transaction". This indicates how long-lived the <em>EntityManager</em> should preferably be.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Returns</em>      
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        A configured EntityManager.        
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>EntityManagerFactory getEntityManagerFactory()</strong>      
    </p>
    <p>
      Returns the underlying <em>EntityManagerFactory</em>. This will return null if isValid() return false!      
    </p>

    <H1>APSJSONService</H1>
    <p>
      This provides exactly the same functionallity as APSJSONLib. It actually wraps the library as a service. The reason for that is that I wanted to be able to redeploy the library without forcing a redeploy of the Bunde using it. A redeploy of the library will force a redeploy of this service, but not the client of this service. The APS clients of this service uses APSServiceTracker wrapped as a service and thus handles this service leaving and returning without having to care about it.      
    </p>
    <p>
      This service and the library existrs for internal use. It is here and can be used by anyone, but in most cases like serializing java beans back and forth to JSON (which this can do) Jacksson would still be a better choice and offers more flexibility. In the long run I’m going to see if I can replace the internal use of this with Jacksson as well.

    <H1>APSResolvingBundleDeployer</H1>
    <p>
      This is a bundle deployer that is intended as an alternative to the server provided deployer.      
    </p>
    <p>
      This bundle deployer will try to automatically resolve deploy dependencies. It does this by having a fail threshold. If the deploy of a bundle fails it just keeps quiet and put the bundle at the end of the list of bundles to deploy. It updates the try count for the bundle however. Next time the bundle is up for deploy it might have the dependencies it needs and will deploy. If not it goes back to the end of the list again and its retry count is incremented again. This repeats until the retry count reaches the threshold value in which case an error is logged and the bundle will not be attempted to be deployed again unless it gets a new timestamp on disk.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassfish does something similar, but Virgo fails completely unless bundles are deployed in the correct order. You have to provide a par file for Virgo to deploy correctly.      
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one catch to using this deployer: It does not handle WAB bundles! Neither Glassfish nor Virgo seems to handle WAB deployment using the OSGi extender pattern. If they did they would recognize a WAB being deployed even though it is deployed by this deployer and handle it. They dont!      
    </p>
    <H2>Configuration</H2>
    <p>
      The following configuration is available for this deployer. Edit this in /apsadminweb ”Configurations” tab under the <em>aps</em> node.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>deployDirectory</strong> - The directory to deploy bundles from. All bundles in this directory will be attempted to be deployed.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>failThreshold</strong> - The number of failed deploys before giving upp. The more bundles and the more dependencies among them the higher the value should be. The default value is 8.      
    </p>
    <H1>APSSessionService</H1>
    <p>
      This service provides session storage functionality. You can create a session, get an existing session by its id, and close a session. Each session can hold any number of named objects.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Why a session service ? To begin with, this is not an HttpSession! That said, it was created to handle a single session among several web applications. This for the APS administration web which are made up of several web applications working toghether. This is explained in detail in the APSAdminWeb documentation.

    <p>
      The idea behind this variant is to support distributed sessions. The implementation must use a session id that is unique enough to support this. The APS implementation uses java.util.UUID.

    <p>
      <strong>void closeSession(String sessionId)</strong>      
    </p>
    <p>
      Closes the session represented by the specified id. After this call APSSession.isValid() on an <em>APSSession</em> representing this session will return false.

      This is actually a service directory that also multicasts on the network to find other instances of itself and makes the services in other instances available also.      
    </p>
    <p>
      A <em>service</em> here means anything that can be called either with an URL or a host and port. It does not specifically indicate what type of service it is. Each published service however has an id that can be used to better identify it. Basically clients of services have to know the id of the service they want and by that know what it is and how to talk to it.

    <H1>APSExternalProtocolExtender</H1>
    <p>
      This is an OSGi bundle that makes use of the OSGi extender pattern. It listens to services being registered and unregistered and if the services bundles <em>MANIFEST.MF</em> contains <code>APS-Externalizable: true</code> the service is made externally available. If the <em>MANIFEST.MF</em> contains <code>APS-Externalizable: false</code> however making the service externally available is forbidden. A specific service can also be registered containing an <em>aps-externalizable</em> property with value <em>true</em> to be externalizable. This overrides any other specification.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The exernal protocol extender also provides a configuration where services can be specified with their fully qualified name to be made externally available. If a bundle however have specifically specified false for the above manifest entry then the config entry will be ignored.      
    </p>
    <p>
      So, what is meant by <em>made externally available</em> ? Well what this bundle does is to analyze with reflection all services that are in one way or the other specified as being externalizable (manifest or config) and for all callable methods of the service an <em>APSExternallyCallable</em> object will be created and saved locally with the service name. <em>APSExternallyCallable</em> extends <em>java.util.concurrent.Callable</em>, and adds the possibility to add parameters to calls and also provides meta data for the service method, and the bundle it belongs to. There is also an <em>APSRESTCallable</em> that extends <em>APSExternallyCallable</em> and also takes an http method and maps that to a appropriate service method.      
    </p>
    <H2>The overall structure</H2>
    <p>
      The complete picture for making services externally callable looks like this:      
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      This bundle provides the glue between the services and the protocols. Transports and protocols have to be provided by other bundles.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The flow is like this:      
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Transport gets some request and an InputStream.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Transport gets some user selected protocol (The APSExtProtocolHTTPTransportProvider allows specification of both protocol, protocol version, and service to call in the URL).          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Transport calls <em>APSExternalProtocolService</em> to get requested protocol.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Transport calls protocol to parse InputStream and it returns an <em>RPCRequest</em>.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Transport uses the information in the RPCRequest to call a service using <em>APSExternalProtocolService</em>.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Transport takes the result from the call and passes to the protocol along with an OutputStream to write response on.          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <H2>APSExternalProtocolService</H2>
    <p>
      This bundle registers an <em>APSExternalProtocolService</em> that will provide all <em>APSExternallyCallable</em> instances (or rather copies of them since you can modify the one you get back by providing arguments). This service also provides getters for available remote protocols and you can register with it to receive information about chages for services and protocols.      
    </p>
    <H3>Protocols</H3>
    <p>
      There is a base API for protocols: <em>RPCProtocol</em>. APIs for different types of protocols should extend this. The protocol type APIs are service APIs and services implementing them must be provided by other bundles. This bundle looks for and keeps track of all such service providers.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>StreamedRPCProtocol</em> extends <em>RPCProtocol</em> and provides a method for parsing a request from an <em>InputStream</em> returning an <em>RPCRequest</em> object. This request object contains the name of the service, the method, and the parameters. This is enough for using <em>APSExternalProtocolService</em> to do a call to the service. The request object is also used to write the call response on an OutputStream. There is also a method to write an error response.      
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the responsibility of the transport provider to use a protocol to read and write requests and responses and to use the request information to call a service method. An exception is the case of http transports supporting REST that must take the responibility for returning an http status.      
    </p>
    <H3>Getting information about services and protocols.</H3>
    <p>
      A transport provider can register themselves with the <em>APSExternalProtocolService</em> by implementing the <em>APSExternalProtocolListener</em> interface. They will then be notified when a new externalizable service becomes available or is leaving and when a protocol becomes available or is leaving.      
    </p>
    <H2>WARNING - Non backwards compatible changes!</H2>
    <p>
      This version have non backwards compatible changes! <em>StreamedRPCProtocol</em> have changed in parameters for <em>parseRequest(...)</em> and <em>isRest()</em> is gone. <em>RPCProtocol</em> have changes in parameters for crateRPCError(...). The error code is now gone. These changes was a necessity! The old was really bad and tried to solve REST support in a very stupid way. It is now handled very much more elegantly without any special support for it with <em>is</em>methods!      
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>APSExtProtocolHTTPTransportProvider</em> now checks if an <em>RPCError</em> (returned by createRPCError(...)) object actually is an <em>HTTPError</em> subclass providing an HTTP error code to return.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>parseRequest(...)</em> parameters now also contain the class of the service and a new RequestIntention enum. The service class is only for inspecting methods for annoations or other possible meta data. The JSONREST protocol for example uses this to find annotations indicating GET, PUT, DELETE, etc methods, which is far more flexible than the old solution of requiring a get(), put(), etc method. The RequestIntention enum provides the following values: CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE, UNKNOWN. That is CRUD + UNKNOWN. It will be UNKNOWN if the transport cannot determine such information. These are basically to support REST protocols without being too HTTP specific. Other transports can possible also make use of them.

      This service makes the currently available externalizable services available for calling. It should be used by a bundle providing an externally available way of calling a service (JSON over http for example) to translate and forward calls to the local service. The locally called service is not required to be aware that it is called externally.

      <strong>Never cache any result of this service!</strong> Always make a new call to get the current state. Also note that it is possible that the service represented by an APSExternallyCallable have gone away after it was returned, but before you do call() on it! In that case an APSNoServiceAvailableException will be thrown. Note that you can register as an APSExternalProtocolListener to receive notifications about externalizable services coming and going, and also protocols coming and going to keep up to date with the current state of things.

    <H1>APSExtProtocolHTTPTransportProvider</H1>
    <p>
      This provides an http transport for simple remote requests to OSGi services that have "APS-Externalizable: true" in their META-INF/MANIFEST.MF. This follows the OSGi extender pattern and makes any registered OSGi services of bundles having the above manifest entry available for remote calls over HTTP. This transport makes use of the aps-external-protocol-extender which exposes services with the above mentioned manifest entry with each service method available as an APSExternallyCallable.The aps-ext-protocol-http-transport-provider for example acts as a mediator between the protocol implementations and aps-external-protocol-extender for requests over HTTP.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that depending on protocol not every service method will be callable. It depends on its arguments and return value. It mostly depends on how well the protocol handles types and can convert between the caller and the service.      
    </p>
    <p>
      This does not provide any protocol, only transport! For services to be able to be called at least one protocol is needed. Protocols are provided by providing an implementation of se.natusoft.osgi.aps.api.net.rpc.service.StreamedRPCProtocol and registering it as an OSGi service. The StreamedRPCProtocol API provides a protocol name and protocol version getter which is used to identify it. A call to an RPC service looks like this:      
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://host:port/apsrpc/<em>protocol</em>/<em>version</em>[/<em>service</em>][/<em>method</em>]      
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>protocol</em> - This is the name of the protocol to use. An implementation of that protocol must of course be available for this to work. If it isn't you will get a 404 back! The protocol service (RPCProtocol&lt;-StreamedRPCProtocol) provides a name for each protocol. It is this name that is referenced.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>version</em> - This is the version of the protocol. If this doesn't match any protocols available you will also get a 404 back.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>service</em> - This is the service to call. Depending on the protocol you might not need this. But for protocols that only provide method in the stream data like JSONRPC for example, then this is needed. When provided it has to be a fully qualified service interface class name.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>method</em> - This is the method to call. The need for this also depends on the protocol. A REST protocol would need it. The JSONRPC protocol does not. When this is specified in the URL then it will be used even if the protocol provides the method in the request! Please note that a method can be specified on two ways:      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          method(type,...)          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          method          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The method will be resolved in that order. The parameter type specifying version is required when there are several methods with the same name but different parameters. The method name only will give you the last one in that case.      
    </p>
    <H2>Examples</H2>
    <p>
      See examples under the <strong>APSStreamedJSONRPCProtocolProvider</strong> section.      
    </p>
    <H2>Authentication</H2>
    <p>
      Authentication for services are provided in 2 ways. Both require a userid and a password and both validate the user using the APSAuthService.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2 alternatives are:      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          http://.../apsrpc/<strong>auth:user:password</strong>/protocol/...          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Basic HTTP authentication using header: 'Authorization: Basic {<em>base 64 encoded user:password</em>}’.          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      One of these will be required if the <em>requireAuthentication</em> configuration have been enabled.      
    </p>
    <H2>The help web</H2>
    <p>
      Opening the <em>http://.../apsrpc/_help/</em> URL will give you a web page that provides a lot of information. This page requires authentication since it register itself with the APSAdminWeb (/apsadminweb) as ”Remote Services” and appears there as a tab, and thus joins in with the APSAdminWeb authentication.      
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to much of the same information as in this documentation it also lists all protocols tracked by the <em>APSExternalProtocolExtender</em> with their name, version, description, and other properties. Next it lists all services that <em>APSExternalProtocolExtender</em> provides as callable. Each of these services are a link that can be clicked. Clicking on a service will show all the methods of the service and then list the call url for each method per protocol. Each method listed is also a link, and clicking that link will give you a page where you can provide arguments and then press execute to call the service. The result will be displayed as JSON on the same page. This is very useful for testing and debugging services.      
    </p>
    <H2>See Also</H2>
    <p>
      Also look at the documentation for APSExternalProtocolExtender.      
    </p>
    <H1>APSGroups</H1>
    <p>
      Provides network groups where named groups can be joined as members and then send and receive data messages to the group. This is based on multicast and provides a verified multicast delivery with acknowledgements of receive to the sender and resends if needed. The sender will get an exception if not all members receive all data. Member actuality is handled by members announcing themselves relatively often and will be removed when an announcement does not come in expected time. So if a member dies unexpectedly (network goes down, etc) its membership will resolve rather quickly. Members also tries to inform the group when they are doing a controlled exit.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that this does not support streaming! That would require a far more complex protocol. APSGroups waits in all packets of a message before delivering the message.      
    </p>
    <H2>OSGi service usage</H2>
    <p>
      The APSGroupsService can be used as an OSGi service and as a standalone library. This section describes the service.      
    </p>
    <H3>Getting the service</H3>
    <pre>
      <code>
    APSServiceTracker&lt;APSGroupService&gt; apsGroupsServiceTracker = 
        new APSServiceTracker&lt;APSGroupsService&gt;(bundleContext, APSConfigService.class,
        APSServiceTracker.LARGE_TIMEOUT);
    APSGroupsService apsGroupsService = apsGroupsServiceTracker.getWrappedService();
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H3>Joining a group</H3>
    <pre>
      <code>
    GroupMember groupMember = apsGroupsService.joinGroup("mygroup");
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H3>Sending a message</H3>
    <p>
      To send a message you create a message, get its output stream and write whatever you want to send on that output stream, close it and then send it. <em>Note</em> that since the content of the message is any data you want, all members of the groups must know how the data sent looks like. In other words, you have to define your own message protocol for your messages. Note that you can wrap the OutputStream in an ObjectOutputStream and serialize any java object you want.      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    Message message = groupMember.createNewMessage();
    OutputStream msgDataStream = message.getOutputStream();
    try {
        ...
        msgDataStream.close();
        groupMember.sendMessage(message);
    }
    catch (IOException ioe) {
        ...
    }
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that the <code>groupMember.sendMessage(message)</code> does throw an IOException on failure to deliver the message to all members.      
    </p>
    <H3>Receiving a message</H3>
    <p>
      To receive a message you have to register a message listener with the GroupMember object.      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    MessageListener msgListener = new MyMsgListener();
    groupMember.addMessageListener(myMsgListener); 
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      and then handle received messages:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    public class MyMsgListener implements MessageListener {
        public void messageReceived(Message message) {
            InputStream msgDataStream = message.getInputStream();
            ...
        }
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H3>Leaving a group</H3>
    <pre>
      <code>
    apsGroupsService.leaveGroup(groupMember);
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H2>Library usage</H2>
    <p>
      The bundle jar file can also be used as a library outside of an OSGi server, with an API that has no other dependencies than what is in the jar. The API is then slightly different, and resides under the se.natusoft.apsgroups package.      
    </p>
    <H3>Setting up</H3>
    <pre>
      <code>
    APSGroups apsGroups = new APSGroups(config, logger);
    apsGroups.connect();
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The config passed as argument to APSGroups will be explained further down under "Configuration".      
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>logger</em> is an instance of an implementation of the APSGroupsLogger interface. Either you provide your own implementation of that or your use the APSGroupsSystemOutLogger implementation.      
    </p>
    <H3>Joining a group</H3>
    <pre>
      <code>
    GroupMember groupMember = apsGroups.joinGroup("mygroup");
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H3>Sending and receiving messages</H3>
    <p>
      Sending and receiving works exactly like the OSGi examples above.      
    </p>
    <H3>Leaving a group</H3>
    <pre>
      <code>
    apsGroups.leaveGroup(groupMember);
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H3>Shutting down</H3>
    <pre>
      <code>
    apsGroups.disconnect();
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <H2>Net time</H2>
    <p>
      All APSGroups instances connected will try to sync their time. I call this synced time "net time".      
    </p>
    <p>
      It works like this: When an APSGroups instance comes up it waits a while for NET_TIME packets. If it gets such a packet then it enters receive mode and takes the time in the received NET_TIME packet and stores a diff to that time and local time. This diff can then be used to translate back and forth between local and net time. If no such packet arrives in expected time it enters send mode and starts sending NET_TIME packets itself using its current net time. If a NET_TIME packet is received when in send mode it directly goes over to listen mode. If in listen mode and no NET_TIME packet comes in reasonable time it goes over to send mode. So among all instances on the network only one is responsible for sending NET_TIME. If that instance leaves then there might be a short fight for succession, but it will resolve itself rather quickly.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The GroupMember contains a few <em>create*</em> methods to produce a <em>NetTime</em> object instance. See the API further down for more information on these.      
    </p>
    <H2>Configuration</H2>
    <H3>OSGi service </H3>
    <p>
      The OSGi service provides a configuration model that gets managed by the APSConfigService. It can be configured in the APS adminweb (http://host:port/apsadminweb/). Here are some screenshots of the config admin:      
    </p>
    <p>
            <img src='http://download.natusoft.se/Images/APS/APS-Network/APSGroups/docs/images/groups-config-1.png' title='' alt='/apsconfigadmin web gui for configuring APSGroups 1'/>       <img src='http://download.natusoft.se/Images/APS/APS-Network/APSGroups/docs/images/groups-config-2.png' title='' alt='/apsconfigadmin web gui for configuring APSGroups 2'/>       <img src='http://download.natusoft.se/Images/APS/APS-Network/APSGroups/docs/images/groups-config-3.png' title='' alt='/apsconfigadmin web gui for configuring APSGroups 3'/>       <img src='http://download.natusoft.se/Images/APS/APS-Network/APSGroups/docs/images/groups-config-4.png' title='' alt='/apsconfigadmin web gui for configuring APSGroups 4'/>      
    </p>
    <p>
      As can bee seen in the above screenshots transports need to be configured for communication to work. If you only need to talk to members on the same subnet the multicast transport is enough! The multicast transport makes sure that all transmitted data is received by all known group members. It will do resends if required, and throw an exception on failure of any member to acknowledge all sent packets.      
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need to talk to members on a different subnet then you need to use the TCP transports. Note that there are 2 of these: <em>TCP_SENDER</em>, and <em>TCP_RECEIVER</em>. One receiver must be configured and can receive messages from anyone. A sender is needed for each APSGroups installation you want to talk to, and should point to the receiver of that installation. Note that for a receiver you only need to specify a port. The host part is ignored by the receiver.      
    </p>
    <H3>Library </H3>
    <p>
      The library wants an implementation of the APSGroupsConfig interface as its first argument to APSGroups(config, logger) constructor. Either you implement your own or use the APSGroupsConfigProvider implementation. This is a plain java bean with both setters and getters for the config values. It comes with quite reasonable default values. It contains exactly the same properties as shown in the screenshots above.      
    </p>

    <H1>APS Message Service Sync Service Provider</H1>
    <p>
      As this long name suggests this service provides an implementation of APSSyncService using APSMessageService to do the synchronization.

    <p>
      public <em>interface</em> <strong>APSSynchDataService </strong>   [se.natusoft.osgi.aps.api.net.sync.service] {

    <p>
      This service allows you to store data using a unique key, similar to java.util.Map. The difference is that this data is synchronized between nodes. So if data is published on one node, that data will be available on all other member nodes where it can be fetched. It works like a distributed map.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Since all data stored are also held in memory, take care in what you store here.

    <H1>APS Net Time Servcie Provider</H1>
    <p>
      This provides a service for converting time between a common network time and local time. The actual net time is provided by APSGroupsService which must be running for this service provider to work. This also means that it will only work between hosts on the same subnet and multicast must be supported on that subnet.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea with this service is that no matter what the local host time is, time critical data passed on the network can be reasonably compared between hosts, by agreeing on a common <em>now</em> time and the diff between local time and this common time.      
    </p>
    <p>
      As said above, this implementation have limitations!

      This service provides network neutral time. Even with NTP it is difficult to keep the same time on different servers. This service creates a network timezone and broadcasts the network time. It supports converting local time to network time and converting network time to local time.

    <H1>APSStreamedJSONRPCProtocolProvider</H1>
    <p>
      This provides JSONRPC protocol. It provides both version 1.0 and 2.0 of the protocol. It requires a transport that uses it and services provided by aps-external-protocol-extender to be useful.      
    </p>
    <p>
      JSONRPC version 1.0 protocol as described at <a href='http://json-rpc.org/wiki/specification' title=''>http://json-rpc.org/wiki/specification</a>.      
    </p>
    <p>
      JSONRPC version 2.0 protocol as describved at <a href='http://jsonrpc.org/spec.html' title=''>http://jsonrpc.org/spec.html</a>.      
    </p>
    <p>
      JSONHTTP version 1.0 which is not any standard protocol at all. It requires both service name and method name on the url, and in case of HTTP GET or DELETE also arguments as ?params=arg:...:arg where values are strings or primitives. For POST, and PUT a JSON array of values need to be written on the stream.      
    </p>
    <p>
      JSONREST version 1.0 extending JSONHTTP will make the http transport always map methods annotated with @RESTGET, @RESTPUT, @RESTPOST, and @RESTDELETE to the corresponding http methods. This also does not require a method to be specified on the URL, and will ignore any specified method.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally I think that JSONRPC 2.0 is far more flexible than REST.      
    </p>

    <p>
      In this case we didn't just use <em>createSession</em> as method name, but <em>createSession(Integer)</em> though with parentheses escaped to not confuse the shell. This is because there is 2 variants of createSession: createSession(String, Integer) and createSession(Integer). If we don't specify clearly we might get the wrong one and in this case that happens and will fail due to missing second parameter. Also note the <em>params=5</em>. On get we cannot pass any data on the stream to the service, we can only pass parameters on the URL which is done by specifying url parameter <em>params</em> with a colon (:) separated list of parameters as value. In this case only String and primitives are supported for parameters.      
    </p>
    <p>
      These examples only works if you have disabled the <em>requireAuthentication</em> configuration (network/rpc-http-transport).

    </p>
    <p>
      This is a web app for administration of APS. It is really only a shell for different administraion webs. It relys on the <em>aps-admin-web-service-provider</em> bundle which publishes the <em>APSAdminWebService</em>. Other bundles providing administration web apps register themselves with this service and for each registration APSAdminWeb creates a tab in its gui. Se <em>APIs</em> further down for the APSAdminService API. Clicking on ”Refresh” will make APSAdminWeb reload the admin webs registered in <em>APSAdminWebService</em>.      
    </p>
    <p>
      The APSAdminWeb is accessed at <strong>http://host:port/apsadminweb</strong>. What you see there depends on what other admin webs are deployed. Anybody can make an admin web and register it with the <em>APSAdminWebService</em>. The admin webs delivered with APS are mainly done using Vaadin. This is in no way a requirement for an admin web. An admin web app can be made in any way what so ever. A side effect of this is that different tabs might have different look and feel. But I choose flexibility over beauty!      
    </p>
    <p>
      The following APS bundles provides a tab in APSAdminWeb:      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>aps-config-admin-web.war</em> - Allows advanced configuration of bundles/services using APSConfigService.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>aps-user-admin-web-war</em> - Administration of users and groups for APSSimpleUserService.          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>aps-ext-protocol-http-transport-provider.war</em> - Provides a web gui with help for setting up and calling services remotely, and also shows all available services and allows calling them from the web gui for testing/debugging purposes.          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <H2>Authentication</H2>
    <p>
      If <em>”Configuration tab</em>,<em> Configurations/aps/adminweb/requireauthentication”</em> property is enabled then the APSAdminWeb requires a login to be accessed. A userid and a password will be asked for. The entered information will be validated by the APSAuthService. The <em>aps-simple-user-service-auth-service-provider.jar</em> bundle provides an implementation of this service that uses the <em>APSSimpleUserService</em> service. The APSAuthService is however simple enough to implement yourself to provide login to whatever you want/need.      
    </p>
    <p>
            <img src='http://download.natusoft.se/Images/APS/APS-Webs/APSAdminWeb/docs/images/APSAdminWeb-login.png' title='' alt='APSAdminWeb login screenshot'/>      
    </p>
    <H2>Making an admin web participating in the APSAdminWeb login.</H2>
    <p>
      There is an APSSessionService that was made just for handling this. It is not a HTTP session, just a service hanling sessions. It is provided by the <em>aps-session-service-provider.jar</em> bundle. When a session is created you get a session id (an UUID) that needs to be passed along to the other admin webs through a cookie. <em>APSWebTools</em> (<em>aps-web-tools.jar</em> (not a bundle!)) provides the APSAdminWebLoginHandler class implementing the LoginHandler interface and handles all this for you.      
    </p>
    <p>
      You need to provide it with a BundleContext on creation since it will be calling both the <em>APSAuthService</em> and <em>APSSessionService</em>:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    this.loginHandler = new APSAdminWebLoginHandler(bundleContext);
    
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Then to validate that there is a valid login do:      
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
    this.loginHandler.setSessionIdFromRequestCookie(request);
    if (this.loginHandler.hasValidLogin()) {
        ...
    }
    else {
        ...
    }
      </code>

    <p>
      This allows editing configurations registered with the <em>APSConfigService</em>. Configurations are only available in the APSConfigAdminWeb while the bundle providing the configuration model are deployed. The actual saved configurations live on disk and remains after a bundle is stopped. It will be available again when the bundle is started again. But the bundle have to be running and regisitering its configuration with the <em>APSConfigService</em> for them to be editable in this admin app!      
    </p>
    <p>
      As can be seen in the screenshots above it provides a simpler gui for simple configs, and a more advanced gui for structured configurations containing list of other configuration models.      
    </p>
    <H2>Config Environments</H2>
    <p>
      Under this node all available configuration environments are listed. Right clicking on the node will drop down a menu alternative to create a new configuration environment. Right clicking on a configuration environment pops up a menu that allows it to be set as active configuration environment or to delete the configuration environment. Just clicking on a configuration environment allows it to be edited on the right side. The active configuration environment cannot however be edited, only viewed.      
    </p>
    <H2>Configurations</H2>
    <p>
      This tree cannot be edited. What is here is the configurations registered by bundles. They can be selected to edit the selected configuration to the right. The screenshots above shows 2 examples of such. Please note that the screenshots were taken on a Mac with Mountain Lion and thus does not show scrollbars unless scrolling. The right side of the second screenshot where things are slightly cutoff at the bottom are scrollable!      
    </p>
    <p>
      On top of the right side box there is a dropdown menu that shows/selects the configuration environment you are editing configuration values for. Only configuration values that are marked in the configuration model as being configuration environment specific will get different values per configuration environement. Those values that are configuration environment specific are identified by having the configuration environment in parentesis after the configuration value key. If you switch the configuration environment in the top dropdown menu you will se that these values change.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Boolean configuration values will be shown as checkboxes. Date configuration values will have a date field where the user can write a date or click the button on the end to bring upp a calendar to select from. Date configuration values can also specify the date format (as described <a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html' title=''>here</a>) in the configuration model. This is used to display the date in the field and parse any entered date. So different date fields can have different formats!      
    </p>
    <p>
      The configuration models are annotated and provide descriptions of the values which are shown in the gui to make it easy for the person doing the configuration to know what the configuration is about.      
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the configuration changes are saved they become active. The code using the configurations doesn’t need to do anything. The next reference to a configuration value will return the new value.      
    </p>

      Also se the APSConfigService documentation.

    <H1>APSUserAdminWeb</H1>
    <p>
            <img src='http://download.natusoft.se/Images/APS/APS-Webs/APSUserAdminWeb/docs/images/APSUserAdminWeb.png' title='' alt='APSUserAdminWeb screenshot'/>      
    </p>
    <p>
      APSUserAdminWeb provides user and group administration for the <em>APSSimpleUserService</em>.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Users are splitt into groups of the first character in the userid to make them a little bit easier to find if there are many. So all userids starting with ’a’ or ’A’ will be under Users/A and so on.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Right click on the <em>Users</em> node to create a new user.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Right click on the <em>Roles</em> node to create a new role.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Warning:</strong> For the roles it is fully possible to create circular dependencies! <strong>Dont!</strong> (There is room for improvement on this point!)      
    </p>
    <p>
      There is not anything more to say about this. It should be selfexplanatory!

      THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

    </ol>
    <p>
      "Contribution" means:      
    </p>
    <p>
      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.      
    </p>
    <p>
      "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.      
    </p>
    <p>
      "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.      
    </p>
    <p>
      "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.      
    </p>
    <p>
      "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.      
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          GRANT OF RIGHTS          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.      
    </p>
    <p>
      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.      
    </p>
    <p>
      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.      
    </p>
    <p>
      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.      
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          REQUIREMENTS          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:      
    </p>
    <p>
      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and      
    </p>
    <p>
      b) its license agreement:      
    </p>
    <p>
      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;      
    </p>
    <p>
      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;      
    </p>
    <p>
      iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and      
    </p>
    <p>
      iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.      
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Program is made available in source code form:      
    </p>
    <p>
      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and      
    </p>
    <p>
      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.      
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.      
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

      If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.      
    </p>
    <p>
      If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.      
    </p>
    <p>
      All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

      This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 2, June 1991
    
     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
                    Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
    the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.
    
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.
    
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.
    
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    
                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
    
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.
    
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.
    
      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.
    
      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    
      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.
    
      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
                    NO WARRANTY
    
      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
                 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
    
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
        with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
        51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
    
      &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
    Public License instead of this License.
