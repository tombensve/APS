<h1>Configuration Environments</h1>
<div class="aps-description-text">
    <p>
        There are usually several deployment environments where some configurations do differ per environment.
        The APS configurations supports different values for different environments. This is the place where
        you define environments. A common scenario is <i>development</i>, <i>systemtest</i>, <i>acceptancetest</i>,
        and <i>production</i>. In some cases there might be several of each. Example: <i>syst1</i>, <i>syst2</i>,
        <i>syst3</i>.
