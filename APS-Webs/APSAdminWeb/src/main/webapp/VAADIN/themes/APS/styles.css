    If you can't get it right in Java with Vaadin, fix it with css :-).

    The problem is that the Tabsheet component leaves about 10-15px below the tab before the tab content.
    This looked really ugly. I tried to fix it with layouts, but nothing worked. Finally I just put a
    style name on the Tabsheet and override the height here.

    The new side-effect is that I now get the pixels I managed to remove at the top at the bottom instead!
    That is however better.
