<h1>About APS Admin Web</h1>
<div class="aps-description-text">
This is a general administration tool for the APS services and other services that wants to make use of it.
Any web application can register with the APSAdminWebService and provide a name and deployment url. A new tab
will be created for each registered web and each registered web application will be embedded within its tab.
<p>
It does however not make much sense to register here if you are not and administration web application for something.
