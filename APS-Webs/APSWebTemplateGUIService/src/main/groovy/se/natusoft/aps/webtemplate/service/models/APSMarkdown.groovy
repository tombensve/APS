 *
 * PROJECT
 *     Name
 *         APS Web Manager
 *
 *     Code Version
 *         1.0.0
 *
 *     Description
 *         This project contains 2 parts:
 *
 *         1. A frontend React web app.
 *         2. A Vert.x based backend that serves the frontend web app using Vert.x http router.
 *
 *         Vert.x eventbus is used to communicate between frontend and backend.
 *
 *         This build thereby also builds the frontend by using maven-exec-plugin to run a bash
 *         script that builds the frontend. The catch to that is that it will probably only build
 *         on a unix machine.

/**
 * This component displays markdown text.
 *
 * Note that in addition to setting value (with ยง forcing new paragraph in one line strings) this
 * component also listens to messages of aps.type "md-text", and content.targetId same as component id.
 * If such is received the content.markdown will be used as text for the component.
 *
 * Example of message:
 *     {
 *         aps: {
 *             type: "md-text"
 *         },
 *         content: {
 *             targetId: "id",
 *             markdown: "markdown text"
 *         }
 *     }
