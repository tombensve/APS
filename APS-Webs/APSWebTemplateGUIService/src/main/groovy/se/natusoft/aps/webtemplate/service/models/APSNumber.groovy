 * PROJECT
 *     Name
 *         APS Web Manager
 *
 *     Code Version
 *         1.0.0
 *
 *     Description
 *         This project contains 2 parts:
 *
 *         1. A frontend React web app.
 *         2. A Vert.x based backend that serves the frontend web app using Vert.x http router.
 *
 *         Vert.x eventbus is used to communicate between frontend and backend.
 *
 *         This build thereby also builds the frontend by using maven-exec-plugin to run a bash
 *         script that builds the frontend. The catch to that is that it will probably only build
 *         on a unix machine.
