# APSWebTools

This is not an OSGi bundle! This is a plain jar containing utilities for web applications. Specifically APS administration web applications. This jar has to be included in each web application that wants to use it.

Among other things it provides support for being part of the APS administration web login (APSAdminWebLoginHandler). Since the APS administration web is built using Vaadin it has Vaadin support classes. APSVaadinOSGiApplication is a base class used by all APS administration webs. 

## APIs

The javadoc for these can be found at [http://apidoc.natusoft.se/APSWebTools](http://apidoc.natusoft.se/APSWebTools).
