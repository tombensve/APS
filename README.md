# Application Platform Services (APS)

__This project is currently work in progress and cannot be expected to be stable!!__

Work is slow, whenever time permits.

To be very clear: **This is currently, and probably for a long time comming, a playground where I'm having fun.** The original (and still active) goal with this is to make a very easy to use web platform, currently based on Vert.x & React.

This project is now using 2 exceptional frameworks: __Vert.x & React__. These both belong to the same category: Things that just work! I have the highest respect for the people behind both of these. These both also supply outstanding documentation.

I started using OSGi (only the base 4 APIs) as a base platform because of the modularity of OSGi. I wanted small individual deployments of functionality and a nice clean way of interacting. OSGi provided that. I did for a short while try to drop OSGi but that turned out to be a bad decision so OSGi stays. The OSGi maintainers are working on making it run on Java 9+ also. So OSGi is not going away.

**Do note:** that APS will run in any OSGi container (well, felix, Karaf, Knopplerfish, Virgo (not sure this is still kicking)). That said, I woudn't exactly call APS a straight OSGi platform. APS started out a long time ago, and provides a lot of own solutions rather than official OSGi stadard solutions. It does its own thing, especially with APSActivator. It just uses base OSGi as a base. APS is also largely coded in Groovy.

__To build__ this you must first follow the instructions here: https://github.com/tombensve/maven-bundle-plugin/blob/master/README.md

This because maven-bundle-plugins usage of bnd causes groovy code to confuse bnd into thinking there is code in default package. After a support discussion with bnd there are options in bnd for solving this, but those are not availabe when bnd is used via maven-bundle-plugin. bnd's own maven plugin is far more primitive however so switching is a big job.

APS have always been about keeping things simple. Easy to use APIs providing only basic functionality with no configurational options API wise. My intentions is to encapsulate complexity and provide the easiest way possible to use for all other code. Each specific implementation is responsible for any configuration needed and I made a more structured configuraton service for other services to use. OSGi basically only gives you properties. My goal with configuration is to provide easy to understand structured configuration.

React is a web component framework that follows my ideas of simplicity and small code to the extreme! Love at fist sight :-).

Vert.x I stumbled upon accidentally, and realized that this is "the shit" I'm been looking for! When I started out with this project (yes, its been a longtime playground) I felt stuck with the JEE web APIs. The requirement of a web container felt limiting, and rather heavyweight.

Vert.x fulfilled my needs and then some. And it is truly easy to set up an HTTP server, handle requests, etc. So Vert.x also fits within my goals of keeping things simple and codewise small. All functionality in library form and no outside container to deploy in (well, there are verticles, but they are not required). You can write small lightweight code that only contains what you need for the specific app, and nothing else. It does pull in a lot of 3rd party libraries, but it still feels a lot smaller than the average JEE container. A _Vertx_ instance is made available as an OSGi service.

APS adds a thin layer on top of Vert.x. In many cases Vert.x is used directly, but for messages there is an APS specific API that uses the concept of routes (not to be confused with http routes, 'route' has become a popular word :-)). Using the APS messaging API it is also possible to install other busses, like RabbitMQ for example accessible through same api, but different routes. It is actually possible to send the same message on multiple busses at the same time by specifying multiple, comma separated routes. If that is useful or not is a completely different question.

Do note that APS needs a clustered Vert.x and will create/join such on startup. It can however be told to start a non clustered Vert.x by system property on start. This can be useful when running in test.

About testing: APS provide a testing tool called APSOSGiTestTools. It actually implements a primitive APS level OSGi container but without classloading, using junit classpaths instead. So most tests run as they would in a real deployment and thus also starts Vert.x. This could cause problems if multiple builds are run concurrently on the same machine, like in a Jenkins for example. But if Vert.x is run unclustered it would probably work if HTTP service tests and similar use random ports. There is no good support for that yet in APS. I'm also considering trying to run tests within docker containers.

Lots of fun ideas, and far to little time ...
